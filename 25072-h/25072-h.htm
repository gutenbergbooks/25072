<h2>AN ILLUSTRIOUS TOWN,&mdash;ANDOVER.</h2>

<p>It is said that there are twenty-six places in the United States by the
name of Andover; yet when the name appears in the public prints it does
not occur to any one to ask which Andover? These facts are suggestive of
the wide knowledge and popularity of this historic town, and the abiding
interest of scattered thousands in its welfare. Her sons have gone forth
to dare and to do upon every field of honorable enterprise. Thousands of
pupils have pursued their studies here, and carry precious memories of
the schools, of teachers, and influences,&mdash;in a word, of Andover.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
In this rapid and general view of the town,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> all that will be
attempted is to connect the past with the present, and to give a picture
of Andover as it is to-day.
<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>The natural attractions of the town are great and permanent in their
character. There are neither gold mines nor alarming precipices, but
there are graceful rivers, a quiet rolling landscape, and extensive
views, shaded walks, and charming drives, because there are &ldquo;more roads
than in any other town in New England;&rdquo; the air is clear and bracing,
the sunsets once seen are not soon forgotten, the wild-flowers spring in
abundance, and the autumnal glory draws many visitors to the town.</p>

<p>When Washington made his tour of the Eastern States, after his
inauguration, he passed through Andover on his way from Haverhill to
Lexington. He spent the night at the Abbott tavern, and left upon the
face of his host&#8217;s little daughter a kiss, which she was so reluctant to
lose that for a week she did not wash her face. In his account of this
trip he makes special mention of the beautiful country through which he
was passing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>All that is most characteristic in our New England landscape finds
its representation here. Its rugged granite breaks with hard lines
through the stubborn soil. Its sweep of hill and valley fills the
eye with various beauty. Its lakes catch its sunlight upon generous
bosoms. Its rivers are New England rivers, ready for work, and yet
not destitute of beauty.

<p>The &ldquo;Hill&rdquo; is one mile from the depot, a very uphill way, but one which
it is well worth the stranger&#8217;s while to travel. Upon its top is a tract
of about two hundred acres, the property of Phillips Academy, upon which
stand the various buildings of the institution, now nearly seventy in
number.</p>

<p>Prof. Keep, in a recent article, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The wide prospect from Andover Hill is suggestive of the world-wide
fame of the school; and the lovely elm-shaded park, in which stand
the buildings of the Theological Seminary, and the church where the
members of the academy worship, is a hardly less peaceful and
charming scholar&#8217;s retreat than are those of the college gardens of
Oxford and Cambridge.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
This elm-shaded park is the beautiful campus of seven or eight acres. In
the background are all the buildings of the Theological Seminary, except
Brechin Hall, and in front of them is the avenue of elms which makes the
&ldquo;Gothic window.&rdquo; Nothing of its kind could be more beautiful. Overhead
are the interlaced branches of the lofty trees, the end of the avenue
forming the exquisite window, through which extends a long vista. On
either side of the mullion one has the view of a church in the distance;
and in the valley of the Merrimac nestles the city of Lawrence.</p>

<p>Not far remote is &ldquo;Carter&#8217;s Hill,&rdquo; with its commanding view and unbroken
quiet, and destined to become a favorite summer resort, for such as wish
to enjoy some of New England&#8217;s choicest scenery, to know some of its
purest life, and to keep within an hour&#8217;s

ride of Boston. Within easy
view are Monadnock, Wachusett, and other smaller mountains; the
beautiful Merrimac River, with its populous valley, and the
graceful, busy Shawshin, where it was said, the Devil baptized the
witches,&mdash;contemptible when thought of as the object of great Boston&#8217;s
covetous desire, but important in its relation to the several mills upon
its course, and for its contribution to the general beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indian Ridge&rdquo; is one of the series of lenticular hills, which continues
to the north-east as far as Portsmouth, N.H., and in an irregular course
may be traced westward to the Connecticut River.</p>

<p>This ridge is supposed to have been the spot of Indian encampments, and
is within a tract of land now owned by the town, and intended as a park.
Near it is the &ldquo;Red Spring,&rdquo; and a mile or two north-east is &ldquo;Den Rock,&rdquo;
all of which are frequently visited by holiday bands of children, and by
students in hours of recreation.</p>

<p>The Andover records date from 1639, and the town was incorporated May 6,
1646. The story of Andover&#8217;s progress from its foundation until the
present, is full of interest. The town&#8217;s part in all the early movements
was most creditable, and full of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
intelligence. At the close of a
century of its life we find vigilance as to the character of its growing
population.</p>

<p>The authorities believed that whatsoever a town soweth, that shall it
also reap. It was therefore in vain that the &ldquo;pauper immigrant&rdquo; or
&ldquo;criminal classes&rdquo; knocked for admittance. It is said that the town was
&ldquo;made up at the beginning of &lsquo;choice men,&rsquo; &lsquo;very desirable&rsquo; and &lsquo;good
Christians.&rsquo;&rdquo;

In few places can the local features of the great Revolutionary struggle
be as well studied as in the ample and well-preserved records of
Andover. It would take many pages to tell what the town did in council
and on the field, in business, and at the fireside, to encourage the
patriots. So loyal was the town that its citizens were greatly trusted,
and a portion of Harvard College library was sent there for its greater
safety.</p>

<p>A pleasant description of the town is given by Thomas Houghton, an
Englishman, who, writing from Andover in 1789, mentions several
characteristics of the people at that period. He says: &ldquo;One thing I must
observe, which, I think, wants rectifying, that is, their pluming pride
when adjoined to apparent poverty,&mdash;no uncommon case!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He adds that they grow &ldquo;their own wool, which they also get spun,
weaved, and dyed, and both the gentlemen I am with, Hon. Samuel Phillips
and his father, who is a justice of the peace, generally appear in their
own manufacture, in imitation of the British.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to property, it seems so well secured from principle in the people
that there is not such use of locks and bolts as in England. Even where
I am, we have five out-door and sixty-two sash windows; yet all the
barage on the doors is a wood catch on the door-snek.&rdquo; ...</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a country has Britain lost by her folly! But this is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> too
large a field to dwell on in a letter; the subject, from even poor me,
would easily draw forth a volume.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>Among the early students in Harvard College, from Andover, was one who
was destined to immortal renown. When the rebellious spirit against
England began to rise, Samuel Phillips, whose father, by the same name,
was then the representative to the General Court, was one of the most
earnest to fan the sacred flame. Choosing &ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; as the theme, while
in college he wrote: &ldquo;We should watch against every encroachment, and
with the fortitude of calm, intrepid resolution oppose them. Unborn
generations will either bless us for our activity and magnanimity, or
curse us for our pusillanimity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1775 he is chosen to represent the town in Provincial Congress, to be
held at the meeting-house in Watertown.</p>

<p>His great life-work now began, a work which will be more fully described
hereafter. In all the relations and duties of student, patriot, business
man, judge, lieutenant-governor, and founder of Phillips Academy, he won
for himself a good report, and helped to lay lasting foundations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phillips School,&rdquo; as it was at first called, was opened April 30, 1778,
in a &ldquo;rude building of one story about 30 &times; 25 feet, done off
temporarily in the plainest manner for the purpose, and not intended for
more than thirty or forty scholars.&rdquo; From this small beginning the
school has developed into the widely-famed Academy, which numbers more
than three thousand graduates, and under whose instruction have passed
about eleven thousand pupils. The limits of this article prevent a
notice of those alumni who have become justly famous, and also of the
very strong faculty of instructors, at whose head stands one of the
foremost of American educators, under whose wise direction Phillips is
fast becoming the synonyme of Rugby, and is already one of the important
sources of supply of student-life for Harvard and Yale.</p>

<p>In 1785 the &ldquo;joiner&#8217;s shop&rdquo; gave place to a new academy, which stood
west of where Brechin Hall now stands, and which was burned in 1818. The
third academy, erected in the same year, is now used as the gymnasium.
In 1865 the present academy came into being. It is a noble structure,
with excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> facilities for educational work. Its spacious hall,
where occur the commencement exercises, and the annual contests for the
various prizes, is adorned by the portraits of many of the Academy&#8217;s
illustrious dead.</p>

<p>The new laboratory is a part, already finished, of the proposed
building, for the use of the classes in the natural sciences.</p>

<p>For want of funds in hand, only the east wing has been built, and this
is now occupied by the class in analytical chemistry. When completed,
the building will be a beautiful and a convenient structure. The walls
will be of pressed brick laid in red mortar, with dark granite base, and
Nova Scotia sandstone trimmings. The roof will be covered with Monson
slate. The basement will be eleven feet high, mostly above ground, and
will serve for the force-pump, heating apparatus, and for rough storage.</p>

<p>The chemical laboratory will occupy the main floor, and will be a room
40 &times; 30 feet. Abundant light and air are to be supplied by windows on
three sides, and the system of ventilation will be excellent.</p>

<p>The advantages aimed at in this building are, ample space, freedom from
dampness, abundant light, the means of speedy and complete ventilation,
good drainage, a minimum of absorbing surfaces, and a minimum of fire
risk. The building, when completed, will have a small side-room for
books and balances, a private laboratory for the instructor in charge,
a spacious lecture-room, a drawing-room, cabinets for the various
collections in geology, mineralogy, etc., now inconveniently distant, a
dry store-room, also corridors, closets, and janitor&#8217;s quarters,
complete.</p>

<p>The chaste and time-honored seal of Phillips Academy was the gift of
John Lowell and Oliver Wendell, the grandfathers of Oliver Wendell
Holmes; and probably, though not certainly, was engraved by Paul Revere.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In 1807 the &ldquo;Class in Theology&rdquo; became a distinct institution, the
first of the kind in the world, whose invested endowment now
reaches nearly a million dollars and which has graduated nearly
2,000 students. The Theological Seminary has passed her 75th
anniversary; yet, as a representative and defender of whatever is
most vigorous, active, and progressive in Christian orthodoxy, she
holds an &aelig;gis that is ageless, and a sceptre imperishable. And it
is said that no one man now living can read even the alphabets of
all the languages through which her sons have sought to interpret
the Word of God to the world. Previous to 1807 the Academy itself
did a most important work in educating young men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> for the Christian
ministry, and has contributed to the education of more clergymen
than any similar school. The Academy has also been a large feeder
of the Seminary and other theological schools, and for long periods
has graduated every year from five to fifteen young men who have
become ministers. Indeed the Academy has been called, not without
reason, itself a Seminary.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p></div>

<p>As another article will be written upon the founders and instructors of
the Seminary, we shall in this speak only of the buildings. At the north
end of the long, elm-shaded avenue stands the chapel. It is built in the
Gothic style, of Andover stone, trimmed with sandstone from Connecticut
and Ohio. It was dedicated in 1876, and is by far the most beautiful,
ecclesiastical structure in the town. The audience worshipping in it is
composed of professors and their families, the students of the
institutions, and a few families living near.</p>

<p>Then follow Phillips Hall and Bartlett Hall, and between them is
Bartlett Chapel, the two former serving as dormitories, and the latter
for lecture and recitation rooms. Nearly opposite the south end of the
avenue is the gymnasium, and in the foreground, nearer the main street,
is the imposing library building Brechin Hall.</p>

<p>Over three thousand students have been connected with this institution,
and the illustrations which accompany this article will awaken tender
and precious memories in the minds of many readers.</p>

<p>In 1830 it was determined to open a school in connection with Phillips
Academy, for the training of teachers. The Stone Academy was erected on
the square nearly opposite the present academy, and a dwelling-house,
also built of stone, was used as the workshop of the students. This
house afterwards became the residence of Prof. C. E. Stowe, D.D., and
his talented wife. It was while living here that she wrote her &ldquo;Key to
Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin,&rdquo; and received the kind and unkind notices of her
great work.</p>

<p>This school was discontinued in 1842, for lack of funds, and the
building was used as the head-quarters of the Academy,&mdash;the recitations
being made in what is now the gymnasium. About twenty years ago it was
burned, and the new academy erected.</p>

<p>Among the buildings in town which have been made historic is what is
known as &ldquo;the old Andover Bookstore,&rdquo;&mdash;so called to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> distinguish it from
the present publishing house. It stands on the top of the hill, is a
brick structure, and is now used as a dwelling-house.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Andover Press has always been closely allied with the literary
institutions of the town. In 1809, but one year after the opening
of the Theological Seminary, Mark Newman, who for fourteen years
had been the eminently respected principal (the third) of Phillips
Academy, resigned his office and engaged in the book business, in
which he continued till near the close of his long life of nearly
eighty-seven years. He died in 1859. Four years after Dea. Newman
opened his bookstore, Flagg &amp; Gould began the printing business, at
first printing for Dea. Newman and others, but soon for themselves
as publishers. The firm of Flagg &amp; Gould remained unchanged for
twenty years. In 1833 they admitted as partner Mark H. Newman, son
of Dea. Newman. Mr. Flagg died the same year; Gould &amp; Newman
continued the business till 1841. They were succeeded by Allen,
Morrill, &amp; Wardwell in 1841, W. H. Wardwell in 1847, Flagg &amp;
Wardwell in 1848, W. F. Draper in 1849.</p>

<p>The relations of the publishing business to the Seminary and the
enthusiasm for theological learning inspired by Prof. Stuart are
well illustrated in the title of Newcome&#8217;s &ldquo;Harmony of the
Gospels,&rdquo; published soon after Flagg &amp; Gould opened their
printing-office: &ldquo;A Harmony in Greek of the Gospels, with Notes, By
William Newcome, D.D., Dublin, 1778: Reprinted from the Text and
Select Various Readings of Griesbach, by the Junior Class in the
Theological Seminary at Andover, under the Superintendence of Moses
Stuart, Associate Professor of Sacred Literature in said Seminary.
Andover: Printed by Flagg and Gould. 1814.&rdquo; This was probably the
first book in Greek published here. Other books have occasionally
been published by the students of the Seminary. The first book in
Hebrew printed at the Andover Press was Stuart&#8217;s Hebrew Grammar,
the Professor himself superintending the type-setting. Inspired by
his zeal, Dr. Codman, in 1821, gave to the Seminary $2,000 for the
purchase of type to be used for printing the Oriental languages, a
kind of work then new in this country hence the name &ldquo;Codman
Press,&rdquo; which appears on the books of early date. Works or parts
of works were printed in as many as ten Eastern languages, a
speciality at Andover which has been continued to the present time.
Equally zealous in his department was Dr. Porter, President, and
Professor of Sacred Rhetoric, in directing the attention of the
clergy to the study of pulpit eloquence. He published largely on
that subject, some of his books attaining a very extensive sale.
Prof. Stuart also published here his Commentaries, some of which,
at the time, greatly agitated the theological world. They still
abide the test of time and survive among the fittest. Having
published as many as six editions of his own Hebrew Grammars, he
translated that of Gesenius, and, in connection with Dr. Robinson,
he translated also the first edition of Winer&#8217;s New Testament Greek
Grammar, then a book of 176 pages, now, in its
seventh&mdash;Thayers&mdash;edition, one of 746 pages. Both of these works in
their greatly improved form still hold the foremost rank as
text-books in their respective departments.</p>

<p>Not far from one hundred and fifty different works of 8vo size,
some of them containing several volumes, among these the
&ldquo;Bibliotheca Sacra,&rdquo; now entering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> on its forty-third year, until
lately edited by Prof. E. A. Park, one of its founders; over one
hundred and fifty books of 12mo and smaller sizes, and more than
two hundred pamphlets, have been published in Andover. Many of
these works were written here (also many others published
elsewhere), and were the outgrowth of the institutions of the
place.</p></div>

<p>At the centennial celebration of Phillips Academy, after speaking of the
literary industry of the faculty, it was said, &ldquo;There have been forty
professors, but their wives and daughters, six women, have published
books which have had a circulation of at least a million copies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Punchard Free School was opened for instruction in 1856. It is
the High School of the town, founded and endowed by Mr. Benjamin H.
Punchard, who left the sum of $70,000 for the founding of a free school.
The school-house is beautifully situated on Punchard avenue, and
hundreds of Andover&#8217;s boys and girls have received great benefit from
Mr. Punchard&#8217;s wise generosity.</p>

<p>William G. Goldsmith, A.M., of Andover, who was the fourth principal,
and a graduate of Harvard College, was elected in 1858. He resigned in
1870, but was re&euml;lected in 1871, and served until his recent appointment
to the service of the Government. The universal respect and affection of
the numerous alumni of &ldquo;Punchard&rdquo; are the well-earned eulogy of his
faithful work.</p>

<p>Its character for good citizenship has never been lost by Andover. There
is a sensitiveness to evil and a vigilant eye for immoralities, which
form the best possible safeguards for a town&#8217;s good name.</p>

<p>The policy of the town is at once conservative and progressive. The
majority sentiment is easily that of an intelligent class of people, who
earnestly seek true progress in all directions, but prefer that all
foolish experiments should be made by other communities.</p>

<p>The business of the town is such as the local demands would naturally
create, and in addition are the large manufacturing interests, at
Ballard Vale: the Tyer Rubber Company, the Stevens Mills of Marland
Village, and the Mills of Smith, Dove, &amp; Co., the makers of the
well-known &ldquo;Andover Thread.&rdquo; All these firms have secured such a
reputation for their goods that while a period of business depression
may lessen the profits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> it has little effect upon the number of hands
employed. The present population of Andover is 5,711. The growth of the
town is not rapid, but has been more so of late than formerly. The
student and business elements steadily increase, and the farm-houses in
the remote parts of the town are favorite summer resorts of such persons
as business connections keep close to Boston, but who wish to escape the
heat and noise of the city.</p>

<p>The number of voters is 893, and of a total vote of 468 upon the
question, &ldquo;Shall licenses be granted for the sale of intoxicating
liquors in this town?&rdquo; the recent declaration was Yes, 141, No, 327. The
desire for improvement in the town can easily be inferred from a
statement of the appropriations for the current year. They amounted to
$77,283.67, of which the following are items:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><em>Voted</em> to appropriate the following sums for the different
departments: For schools, $10,700; school-houses, $1,800;
school-books, $1,000; sidewalks, $1,000; removing snow, $800;
town-officers, $2,500; town-house, $600; fire department, $3,500;
street lamps, $950; printing and stationery, $500; Spring Grove
cemetery, and avails of sales of lots, $300; Memorial Day, $175;

expenses, $4,500; almshouse, relief out of, $3,000; repairs on
almshouse, $500; hay-scales, $50; State tax, $6,000; county tax,
$6,000; adjustment of taxes, $500; discount on taxes, $2,000;
abatement of taxes, $400; interest on notes and funds, $2,000;
insurance, $200; miscellaneous, $1,500; fire-engine for Ballard
Vale, $4,000; highways and bridges, $10,000; water-supply, $10,000;
tree-planting, $100; new streets, $625; etc.</p></div>

<p>For six years past&mdash;1880-85&mdash;the taxes have averaged only $7.25 per
$1,000,&mdash;on a low valuation of property. For healthfulness the town
stands near, if not quite at the head of the list, in the vital
statistics of the State. When the writer was about to make Andover his
place of residence he was heartily congratulated by a friend: &ldquo;People
never die in Andover,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;from disease. They live on, and on, and
on, until their friends weary of them, and shoot them.&rdquo; No one has been
shot recently in Andover, and some have died; but the town is remarkable
for its healthfulness. In 1885 there were 81 deaths, and the average age
was 48+ years; while 40 were 60 years old, and upwards; 27 were over 70;
24 were over 75; 13 were over 80; 4 were over 85, and 2 were over 90.
The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> records of the largest Sabbath school in town show only three
deaths of persons under 20 years of age, for at least eight, and
possibly ten years. The two funerals which the writer last attended were
of persons aged 89 and 101. The Catholic priest informs me that an
entire year has passed without the occurrence of death in his parish. To
show that the statistics of 1885 are not exceptionally favorable to the
name of the town, let us take a longer period,&mdash;say of six years,
1879-85. During this period the death-rate has been 14.45 per 1,000,
which gives an average number of deaths for each year, of 79; and within
this period 159, deaths have been of persons over 70 years of age. Since
the new year came in 15 persons have died, and the average age of 5 was
over 90 years.</p>

<p>Each of the nine churches in Andover has an interesting history. Of
these five are of the Congregational order, and their enrolled
membership numbers 1,099, nearly one-fifth of the entire population.
When to this is added the membership of the Episcopal, Baptist,
Methodist and Catholic churches it is probable that one person in four,
of whatever age or nationality, is a member of some church. The
enrolment of the Sabbath Schools is about the same as that of the
churches.</p>

<p>This is owing partly to the fact that the &ldquo;foreign element&rdquo; in Andover
consists largely of Scotchmen, who love the kirk; and also because the
educational facilities of Andover are such as to draw hither persons of
intelligence, and of literary tastes and habits.</p>

<p>The town is well supplied with libraries. The Memorial Hall was built to
commemorate the Andover defenders of the national flag, and contains a
free reading-room, well supplied with current issues of the press, and a
free public library, containing 5,259 pamphlets, and 9,185 volumes, to
which additions are constantly being made.</p>

<p>In 1865 the Library building of the Theological Seminary was erected,
through the generosity of Mr. John Dove and Messrs. John and Peter
Smith, at the cost of $60,000. It was named &ldquo;Brechin Hall,&rdquo; from their
native town in Scotland.</p>

<p>Its shelves contain more than 43,000 volumes, the gentlemen who built
the library having given large sums for the purchase of books. On its
walls hang the portraits of many of its founders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> and professors, and on
the lower floor is a valuable museum and reference library. Besides
these are various private libraries; and there is a community of taste,
which brings all valuable books to the town in some connection.</p>

<p>Another educational element is that of the public lectures. The People&#8217;s
Course is a thrifty annual, which, each autumn, provides a series of ten
entertainments at merely nominal prices. During the past year there has
also been a course of Emergency Lectures; and various others, upon many
topics, detached from the established courses, are of frequent
occurrence. Abbot Academy provides its annual and popular series of
public &ldquo;Piano Recitals,&rdquo; under the oversight of its efficient professor,
S. M. Downs.</p>

<p>Phillips Academy has its annual contests for the &ldquo;Draper Prizes&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Means Prizes,&rdquo; and a year seldom passes in the history of the
Theological Seminary without one or more courses of special lectures, in
addition to those which are in constant progress, under the regular
instructors of this and of the other institutions. Nor should the
anniversaries, with all the strangers and alumni they bring, the stir
they make, the congratulations and the partings, be forgotten.</p>

<p>So it is that all the important phases of our best American life are
found in the history and enterprise of this illustrious town. Here one
may find the house in which have lived seven generations, the head of
the family bearing the same name; and the home of the recent immigrant.
The educational and business interests are nobly conducted and carried
to great success, and the current life is representative of good old
customs and earnest strivings for the best things.</p>

<p>A careful study of Andover life, such as Rev. Phillips Brooks, D.D., had
evidently made before writing his address for the dedication of the
Memorial Hall, leads one to feel, what he has so well stated:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more we look into the history of Andover the more we feel how
thoroughly it is a characteristic New England town. If I wanted to give
a foreigner some clear idea of what that excellent institution a New
England town really is, in its history and in its character, in its
enterprise and its sobriety, in its godliness and its manliness, I
should be sure that I could do it if I could make him perfectly familiar
with the past and the present of Andover.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>JAMES OTIS, JR.</h2>

<p class="center1">BY REV. H. HEWITT.</p>


<p>Goethe&#8217;s famous saying, that &ldquo;Talent forms itself in solitude;
character, in the stream of life,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> has often found striking
exemplification both in the narrow sphere of individual existence, and
on the broader and more conspicuous stage of national affairs; but
perhaps the truth it contains has seldom been more amply illustrated
than during the stormy days of the American Revolution. Great political
convulsions sift peoples as the wind sifts the wheat on the summer
threshing-floor, bringing into prominence their best as well as their
worst features. They furnish occasion for the development and display of
all that is noblest in mankind, and they offer equal scope and
opportunity to all the baser susceptibilities and passions of our
nature. They furnish a broader platform on which to act, and originate
more exciting topics to occupy and elevate the mind, than are afforded
by an orderly and undisturbed condition of society; and they are
certainly better fitted to create that energy of will and heroism of
purpose without which nothing noble, beneficent, and lasting can ever be
accomplished.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, has this effect been produced in a more impressive
manner, or to a fuller extent, than during the anxious years when the
American colonies were slowly feeling and fighting their way to the
status of an independent nation. A new order of manhood appeared, shaped
by the dangers and difficulties of the time. The crisis called for men
of courage and capacity, of wise council, of prompt and decisive action,
and these men were forthcoming, as if providentially prepared for the
hour and the occasion. Of these, one of the earliest on the scene, and,
for a time, one of the most eloquent and able of the popular leaders,
was James Otis, Junior. Though, in consequence of the sad affliction
that darkened and distressed his later days, his labors in the cause of
American independence were prematurely closed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> and he was not permitted
to share in the consummation of the conflict in which he had played so
prominent, and spirited, and successful a part, he still deserves to be
remembered with gratitude and affection by the nation, now grown big, at
whose birth he so nobly played the part of midwife. James Otis was born
at Great Marshes, now known as West Barnstable, February 5, 1725 (old
style, February 5, 1724). His ancestor, John Otis, came from England
about the year 1657, and settled in the town of Hingham. The family was
from the first distinguished by public spirit, and by aptitude for
places of trust and responsibility in the public service. Besides the
important offices of Judge of the Common Pleas and Judge of Probate,
John Otis had the honor of holding a seat in the Council of the Province
for more than twenty years. His son, James Otis, born 1702, stood
equally prominent in his public capacity, being a distinguished member
of the Bar, an officer of the Militia, a Justice of the Common Pleas and
of Probate, and a Councillor of the Province. He married Mary Allyne, by
whom he had a large family, James, the subject of this sketch, being the
eldest and most celebrated. Samuel Allyne, the youngest of the thirteen
children, served for some time as secretary of the Senate of the United
States. The eldest daughter, Mercy, displayed an aptitude for politics
and literature, in which she acquired considerable reputation in those
unquiet and exciting days, vigorously indorsing and seconding the action
of her brother, and her husband, James Warren, in the Provincial
Council. She was the anonymous author of &ldquo;The Group,&rdquo; a stinging
political satire, published in 1775, and in 1805 she produced a &ldquo;History
of the American Revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the habits, character, and status of Otis, as a student at Harvard,
whither he went in his fourteenth year, little is known, except what has
descended to us in the shape of anecdote, such as the story of his
playing the violin for a small party of young friends on one occasion,
and suddenly stopping the dance by dropping the instrument, and
exclaiming, &ldquo;So fiddled Orpheus, and so danced the brutes.&rdquo; He, however,
managed to graduate with honors in 1743, and to carry off his Arts
degree in 1746. About two years after leaving college he commenced the
study of the law in the office of Jeremiah Gridley, a lawyer of some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
repute, who, later on, as Attorney-General, defended the famous &ldquo;apple
of discord,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Writs of Assistance,&rdquo; which Otis so brilliantly and
successfully impeached. He resided for a short period, 1748-9, in the
town of Plymouth; but the place of Pilgrim fame was at that time too
slow and dull a place for the quick and active mind and ardent and
ambitious temper of the rising young lawyer, and he removed to Boston,
soon to be absorbed with the duties and difficulties of a large and
lucrative practice, and esteemed and admired as one of the brightest
ornaments of his profession. Nor was the public confidence in him
misplaced, or his popularity without warrant. Governor Hutchinson, who
knew him only in the capacity of a powerful personal and political
opponent, was yet obliged to yield homage to his public and professional
virtues, frankly declaring that &ldquo;He never knew fairer or more noble
conduct in a pleader than in Otis; that he always defended his causes
solely on their broad and substantial foundations.&rdquo; Among other stories
and items of fact put forth in evidence of his contempt of the
pettifogging and professional lying so common in these degenerate days,
is the following: Being engaged on one occasion to recover the amount of
a bill which was alleged by the defendant to have been paid, he
discovered, quite accidentally, among his client&#8217;s papers, as the trial
was proceeding, a receipt in full for the demand before the court. The
paper in question had fallen into his client&#8217;s hands in some way or
another, and he was villanously using this advantage to wrong his
neighbor. As soon as Otis detected the trick his indignation burst forth
like a scorching flame, &ldquo;You are a pretty rascal!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;<em>there</em> is
a receipt for the very demand now before the court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otis&#8217; happiness, however, such as it was, lay outside his home. His
marriage with Ruth Cunningham, which took place in 1755, was far from
being happy. Incompatibility of temper, and radical and stubborn
differences in political principle and sentiment, were the main
ingredients in the chalice of bitterness and woe which both, doubtless,
helped to fill. His only son, a youth of promise, entered the navy as
midshipman, and died at eighteen. His eldest daughter, Elizabeth,
married a loyalist, Captain Brown, who was wounded at Bunker Hill,&mdash;an
alliance that much distressed him. The sad fortune of his second
daughter, Mary, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
another source of grief. She had married Benjamin
Lincoln, eldest son of General Lincoln, who received the sword of
General Cornwallis at the surrender of Yorktown,&mdash;a young lawyer of
considerable promise; but he died at twenty-eight.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remember that in the great drama of the Revolution,
Otis was only one of many distinguished actors, and that, in order to
appreciate the part he played so well, we shall require to give a brief
and rapid sketch of the political situation at the time. The sudden
assertion of the spirit of liberty, which the British Parliament and the
Provincial Legislature, acting under its direction and control, strove
to check and subdue, was the awakening of the colonial communities, not
simply to a consciousness of their political rights, but, also, of a
new-born power to maintain and defend them. During the first hundred
years of colonial history King and Parliament, occupied with affairs of
an absorbing character at home, knew little, and cared even less, about
the fate and fortunes of the men and women, who, for the sake of
conscience and religious freedom, had left the land of their birth and
best affection, and were engaged in a heroic contest with nature, on a
wild, desolate, and distant coast. The early colonists were left to a
liberty almost as unfettered as the wild animals and savage tribes whom
they dislodged from their native forests. When, however, the infant
communities had grown strong and prosperous, and had initiated a system
of commerce which bade fair to become expansive and lucrative, they at
once attracted the attention of the State authorities in the land of
their origin. When the conflict with Parliament began, the rights and
immunities claimed by the American colonies, were not matters of statute
and charter. The prescriptive right, which is founded in
long-established custom and usage, rather than in positive enactment,
was the ground of resistance to the encroachments of the Provincial
Executive. When James Otis, in pleading against the &ldquo;Writs of
Assistance,&rdquo; said, &ldquo;Taxation without representation is tyranny,&rdquo; he
stated a great political principle; he indicated the great palladium of
popular liberty; but deeper than that principle, in the hearts of the
colonists, lay the sense of uneasiness at the prospect of having the
privileges of one hundred and fifty years in any way compromised,
disturbed, or imperilled. This was the spirit of Franklin, in his &ldquo;Hints
for a Reply to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Protest of the Lords against the Repeal of the Stamp
Act:&rdquo; &ldquo;I will freely spend nineteen shillings in the pound,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to defend my right of giving or refusing the other shilling; and, after
all, if I cannot defend that right, I can retire cheerfully with my
little family into the boundless woods of America, which are sure to
afford freedom and subsistence to any man who can bait a hook or pull a
trigger.&rdquo; This was the spirit of Otis when he complained that Parliament
regarded the British colonies in America rather as &ldquo;a parcel of small,
insignificant conquered islands, than as very extensive settlement on
the continent,&rdquo; with a future of unlimited development in store. This,
too, was the spirit of Hawley, when, with a boldness outstripping that
of Otis himself, he said, &ldquo;The Parliament of Great Britain has no right
to legislate for us.&rdquo; The latter sentence is memorable as being the
first instance in which the power of the British Parliament was
distinctly denied in a colonial legislature.</p>

<p>Still, side by side with these strong assertions of independence, there
existed curiously enough an almost equally strong feeling of reluctance
to sever the long-standing relation between the colonies and the mother
country. England was still &ldquo;home,&rdquo; even in the language of James Otis,
as is clear from his correspondence, in which he speaks of certain legal
decisions as being &ldquo;sent <em>home</em> for approbation.&rdquo; Though all were agreed
as to the character and tendency of such acts of the imperial
legislature as the Stamp Act, the Revenue Act, the Port Bill, and the
Billeting Bill, hopes were entertained to the last that some method of
solution would be eventually discovered that would avert the disaster of
revolution. &ldquo;In America,&rdquo; said Rev. Andrew Elliot, a popular and
much-respected minister in Boston, &ldquo;the people glory in the name, and
only desire to enjoy the liberties of England.&rdquo; And he added,
significantly enough, &ldquo;Oppression makes wise men mad.&rdquo; Even Thomas
Jefferson, in a letter to John Randolph, as late as 1775, expressed his
decided preference &ldquo;to be dependent on England under proper limitation,
to being dependent on any other nation, or on no nation whatsoever.&rdquo; &ldquo;We
strongly enjoin you,&rdquo; said the Pennsylvania Assembly, November 9, 1775,
largely influenced by Farmer Dickenson, in its instructions to its
delegates, &ldquo;that you, in behalf of this colony, dissent from and utterly
reject any proposition, should such be made, that may cause or lead to
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
separation from our mother country, or a change of the form of this
government.&rdquo; In almost identical words the Assembly of New Jersey
expressed its dread of &ldquo;separation from England.&rdquo; &ldquo;For what are we to
encounter the horrors of war?&rdquo; asked a writer in the <em>New York Gazette</em>,
April 8, 1776, as quoted by Mr. Oscar Straus, in his admirable little
work on &ldquo;The Origin of the American Republic.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is a form of
government which Baron Montesquieu, and the best writers on the subject,
have shown to be attended with many mischiefs and imperfections, while
they pay high encomiums on the excellency of the British Constitution.
The Continental Congress has never lisped the least desire for
independency or republicanism. All their publications breathe another
spirit.&rdquo; What strong ground the <em>Gazette</em> had for the above statement
will be seen from the words of the address sent to the British
Parliament and People by the Congress of Delegates which met on the 5th
September, 1774, at Carpenter&#8217;s Hall, Philadelphia. &ldquo;You have been
told,&rdquo; says the Congress, &ldquo;that we are impatient of government and
desirous of independence. These are calumnies. Permit us to be free as
yourselves, and we shall esteem a union with you to be our greatest
glory and our greatest happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is always the unexpected that happens, however, and, strange as it
may appear, in little more than a year after the publication of the
warnings of the <em>New York Gazette</em>, and the strong deprecations of
leading colonists, the first decisive and irrevocable step towards
revolution of the government and the autonomy and independence of the
colonies was taken. On July 4, 1776, the Rubicon was passed: the
Declaration of Independence was proclaimed.</p>

<p>To trace the causes and indicate the character of this sudden and
irreversible revulsion of feeling is to relate the story of the public
career of James Otis as <em>primus inter pares</em> and leader of the popular
party in the Province of Massachusetts. For ten years, with the
exception of some brief intervals of popular misunderstanding and
disfavor, he stood forth as the eloquent exponent and acknowledged
champion of the popular cause. Long prior to 1760 he had achieved renown
as a lawyer, and the skill and distinction he had attained in his
profession had already received due and appropriate recognition and
reward in his appointment to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Attorney-Generalship of the Province.
In that year, however, the outcry against the administration of the Acts
of Trade became loud and general, and in the discontent and excitement
which prevailed the over-zealous agents of the Executive came into
collision with the people. The revival of an old &ldquo;Act for the better
securing and encouraging the trade of His Majesty&#8217;s colonies in
America,&rdquo; imposed a duty of sixpence on molasses and other articles
imported from the French and Spanish West Indies. As this was tantamount
to doubling the price, the trade was forced into contraband channels,
and vigorous measures had to be adopted for the suppression of the
illicit traffic. A third of the forfeited goods belonged to the king,
and were appropriated for the benefit of the colony; a third belonged to
the governor; and a third fell to the informers. But as that portion of
the spoils which accrued to the colony was not claimed, the money was
used to stimulate the zeal and vigilance of the customs-officers. These
persons, armed with &ldquo;writs of assistance&rdquo; issued by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer in England, were empowered to enter and search any private
house suspected of containing smuggled goods, and seize whatever
articles might be considered contraband within the meaning of the acts.
Against these proceedings resistance was bold and general, suspected
householders answering the demand of the customs-officers by closing the
doors in their faces. It was the duty of Otis, as Advocate-General of
the Province, to uphold the action of the executive government; but he
refused to argue for the writs, and resigned. On his resignation
becoming known he was at once retained, along with Oxenbridge Thacher,
to defend the cause of the people, and his splendid triumph in this
capacity made him the popular hero. His opponent, as has been already
intimated, was his old friend, Jeremiah Gridley, King&#8217;s Attorney,&mdash;a
lawyer of great learning and acuteness. An eye-witness comments on the
sublime spectacle of Otis, spite of the difficulties of his position,
the excitement of the hour, and the fire and vehemence of his own
passionate nature, treating his old master &ldquo;with all deference, respect,
and esteem&rdquo;, but confuting all his arguments, and reducing him to
silence, and Gridley, on the other hand, &ldquo;seeming to exult inwardly at
the glory and triumph of his pupil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In answering, almost at the outset, a charge which made his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>highest
public virtue his fault,&mdash;the charge that he had deserted his
office,&mdash;he said: &ldquo;I renounced that office, and I argue this cause from
the same principle, and I argue it with the greater pleasure as it is in
favor of British liberty at a time when we hear the greatest monarch
upon earth declaring from his throne that he glories in the name of
Briton, and that the privileges of his people are dearer to him than the
most valuable prerogatives of his crown; and it is in opposition to a
kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods of English
history cost one king his head, and another his crown.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>The only principles of public conduct that are worthy of a gentleman or
a man are to sacrifice estate, ease, health, and applause, and even life
itself, to the sacred calls of his country. The glowing and oft-quoted
eulogy of John Adams on this great argument, which is said to have
lasted nearly five hours, is a commonplace of history, but we cannot
forbear repeating it. Otis was a flame of fire; with a promptitude of
classical allusions, a depth of research, a rapid summary of historical
events and dates, a profusion of legal authorities, a prophetic glance
of his eyes into futurity, and a rapid torrent of impetuous eloquence,
he hurried away all before him. American independence was then and there
born. Every man of an immense crowded audience appeared to me to go away
as I did, ready to take up arms against the &ldquo;writs of assistance.&rdquo; The
speech, says Bowen, &ldquo;gave vitality and shape to the dim sense of
oppression and wrong from the mother country, which already rested
indistinctly on the minds of the colonists.&rdquo; &ldquo;It breathed,&rdquo; says Adams,
&ldquo;into this nation the breath of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The effect, however, which John Adams and other admirers of Otis have
ascribed to his great legal triumph was obviously not the one Otis
himself intended it to produce. There was, after all, something
exceedingly vague and uncertain about his attitude and principles as a
politician and a statesman. His contemporaries felt this, and somewhat
unfeelingly accused him of inconsistency. At one time he was equally
censured by his friends and by foes. In his &ldquo;<em>Vindication of the Conduct
of the House of Representatives of the Province of Massachusetts Bay</em>,&rdquo;
published in 1762, occurs the following: &ldquo;The British Constitution of
government, as now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
established in His Majesty&#8217;s person and family, is
the wisest and best in the world. The King of Great Britain is the best
and most glorious monarch upon the globe, and his subjects the happiest
in the universe.&rdquo; And yet Lord Mansfield, whose marble figure stands
proudly among those of other distinguished Englishmen in the corridor of
the British House of Commons, defended him in Parliament, not as a
loyalist, but as a revolutionist. &ldquo;Otis&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a man of
consequence among the people over there. It was said the man is mad.
What then? One madman often makes many. Massaniello was mad, nobody
doubts; yet for all that he overturned the government of Naples.&rdquo;
Friends of the government on both sides of the water suggested that Otis
should be proceeded against for treason, but the British
Attorney-General declared the &ldquo;writs of assistance&rdquo; illegal, and there,
for a time, the matter ended.</p>

<p>When, in January, 1763, preliminaries of peace between France and
England were signed, the people of Boston rejoiced, and Otis, as their
spokesman, said: &ldquo;The true interests of Great Britain and her
plantations are mutual, and what God in His providence has united, let
no man dare attempt to pull asunder.&rdquo; Governor Bernard, however, who
inferred from this strain of remark that the province would soon recover
its reputation for loyalty, seriously overrated its significance. When
the General Assembly of Massachusetts met in 1764, Otis, as chairman of
the Committee of Correspondence, drew up the draft of an address to
Parliament, to prevent the passage of the Stamp Act; but it was not
presented. The act passed into law, and Boston was immediately caught in
a whirlwind of popular indignation and excitement. The mob burnt the
effigy of Oliver, who, in an evil moment, had accepted the office of
Distributor of Stamps, and he, deeming discretion the better part of
valor, resigned his post immediately thereafter, under Liberty-tree. The
house of Hutchinson, Lieutenant Governor, was demolished, while Bernard,
the chief offender, was left undisturbed. Mobocracy, however, was not a
pleasant contemplation to the sober and law-abiding people of Boston,
and next day the inhabitants of the town assembled in Faneuil Hall and
denounced the authors of outrage and violence.</p>

<p>The Stamp Act Congress, originally proposed by Otis, met in New York,
October 19, 1765. He, together with Timothy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Ruggles and Colonel
Partridge, were delegated to attend as the representatives of
Massachusetts. Otis took a prominent and influential part in the
deliberations of the Congress, and was one of the committee chosen to
draft an address to Parliament praying for the repeal of the obnoxious
law, which had nearly brought business to a stand-still in many of the
colonies, for, as Hutchinson remarks, &ldquo;No wills were proved, no
administrations granted, no deeds nor bonds executed.&rdquo; Agitation and
appeal were successful. Parliament beat a retreat and dropped the
attempt to tax the American colonies, like a red-hot poker.
<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
But the breach between the popular party and the friends and representatives of
the government was destined never to be healed. Between Hutchinson and
Otis especially relations were of a very unfriendly character, and it
must have been exceedingly difficult for the partisans on either side to
keep cool when the leaders were so apt to catch fire. Still, when the
Revenue Act of 1767 fell like a firebrand among the colonists, Otis,
singularly enough, was almost alone in advising moderation and caution.
In the following year his action and attitude were more consistent; he
was once more the advocate of resistance, and was appointed to draft
letters to the King, to De Berdt, the agent of the Province in London,
and a circular-letter, addressed to the colonial assemblies, requesting
them &ldquo;to unite in some suitable measures of redress.&rdquo;
<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
Governor Bernard demanded the rescinding of the letters; and Otis replied in a
speech which the Governor described as &ldquo;the most violent, abusive, and
treasonable declaration that perhaps ever was delivered.&rdquo; It is a very
significant indication of the state of popular feeling in Massachusetts
at the time that, while only seventeen members of the House were ready
to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the Governor&#8217;s demand, nintey-two were resolved to say
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; In the summer of 1769 a violent and disgraceful affray took place
between Otis and Robinson, the Commissioner of Customs, in a
coffee-house, in which Otis received a severe blow on the head. From
that moment his public career was practically at an end. He became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> the
victim of insanity. From 1771 to 1783 he lived aloof from the excitement
of public affairs. His death was singularly tragic and fearfully sudden.
As he stood at the door of his home in Andover, during a storm, a flash
of lightning struck him lifeless to the ground; so that he may almost be
said to have been carried to his rest in a chariot of fire.</p>

<p>As to the place of Otis in the early colonial history of America it is
somewhat difficult to state it. His influence as the leader and exponent
of popular opinion was undoubtedly very great so long as it lasted, and
in the main it was beneficial. If, like many another great moral and
political force, he accomplished something entirely different from what
he intended, both what he intended and what he actually accomplished
were equally a credit to him. Some of his contemporaries thought that
his courage, his eloquence, his pure and undiluted patriotism, had a
serious drawback in the irrepressible fire and vehemence of his nature;
but passion enters largely into the composition of all noble natures,
and is, in no inconsiderable degree, the secret of their success. Otis
was certainly wanting in some of the elements of greatness displayed by
the most distinguished of his contemporaries and compatriots. His style
of statemanship was not so far-seeing, comprehensive, and solid as that
of a Samuel Adams, a Thomas Jefferson, a John Dickenson, or a Benjamin
Franklin, and it certainly lacked the Machiavellian coolness and
argumentativeness of a Hutchinson. But what Otis accomplished was
impossible to any of them. His work was quite unique in its way, and his
public life and action have produced results as valuable and lasting as
the public labors of any of the noble men who devoted without stint
their best thought and energies to laying down, deep, strong, and
enduring, the foundation-stones of the American Republic.</p>

<h2>A ROMANCE OF KING PHILIP&#8217;S WAR.</h2>

<p class="center1">BY FANNY BULLOCK WORKMAN.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>CHAPTER I.</strong></p>


<p>One bright afternoon early in the month of June, 1676, a young girl
stood leaning against the trunk of a tree, gazing into the waters of the
beautiful Lake Quinsigamond. Her head rested heavily on her hand, as if
weighed down by the burden of despair. Suddenly she started, uttering a
slight cry, then sank back against the tree with a sigh of relief as she
recognized a tall young Indian who approached her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! is it you, Ninigret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Millicent; fear not, there is no foe near; and if there were I
would protect you. Why do you tremble so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it strange I tremble at the least noise, when the sound of a
footstep or the rustling of a leaf may mean instant death to me? The
forest is full of enemies. They lurk in every by-path. Behind every bush
or fair spreading tree may be seen their leering faces. What, then, has
a poor captive girl to expect of their mercy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not I and those of my tribe here protect you? Have I not already
saved you from death at the hands of a roving Indian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have; perhaps only for a worse fate. Death, indeed, would be no
worse than a future of such captivity; for though you will save me from
the violence of the red men, neither you nor your associates will
liberate me. Ah, Ninigret! why are you so in the power of that tyrant,
Philip? Why will you not brave him, he is so far from here now, and take
me to a white settlement? I promise you no harm shall come to you. You
shall return unhurt to your people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not remember that Wattasacompanum has promised to keep you in
safety until Philip is ready to have you ransomed? Have you forgotten
the solemn rites by which he bound himself the day they brought you to
us? Wattasacompanum is a good chief, a true Indian, who will not break
his promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then, Ninigret, I appeal to you, who have made no promise for me, to
help me to escape to my countrymen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot do that; but I will take you to a place of safety, though it
may be a long, long journey from here. Say, Millicent, will you come
with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go with you, Ninigret, in any direction other than to a white
settlement?&rdquo; replied Millicent, turning her wondering blue eyes full
upon him. &ldquo;Even if such a thing were possible, where would you take me?
Where and how in this time of war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beyond the reach of the present strife, until Philip has driven the
white men from our country. I cannot take you to the whites, for they
will soon be swept from the land. They are much broken up already.
Philip is a mighty chief, and has powerful friends among the Indians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can it be so? No, no; the Indian may do harm and cause suffering, but
surely the white race cannot be exterminated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it can, Millicent; as when, in the spring, the warm sun melts the
snow, causing it to disappear from the dark earth, so will the white men
vanish from this country, leaving the red men in possession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot believe it. Yet how can a poor creature like me, a captive in
the forest, cut off from all communication with her friends, know what
is the real state of affairs outside? In the long months since I was
taken captive rumors have come to me of one town after another being
destroyed or abandoned. Alas! what else may not have happened? Yes, it
is doubtless true. O my God! is it then to be my fate to be held in
life-long bondage, without a friend to whom I can turn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be your friend; come with me. I will take you away from here,
where you are so unhappy, I will make a home for you. We will live
together. You shall be my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wife!&rdquo; and Millicent, deadly pale, clung closer to the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, why not? I am brave and strong; I would guard you from all evil,
and would make you happy. What better have you to hope? Why await
Philip&#8217;s pleasure? You say you have no rich friends to ransom you. If
not, he will marry you himself, and he would not be as kind as I. He is
a hard master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I marry you, or Philip?&rdquo; the young girl murmured, with a look
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> of
dreary terror on her face; then, as if to herself, &ldquo;In fairy tales, as a
child, I read of maidens marrying kings, and wished I were the heroine
of such a tale; but little did I dream that such a king might some time
be offered me for a husband.&rdquo; And she dropped her head upon her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not look so unhappy. Philip is, in truth, no husband for you; but I
am different, and do not hate the white race as he does. He is a fierce
warrior, while I wish but to live in peace, to have you for my wife.&rdquo;
The Indian drew nearer to Millicent. His dark hand stretched forth to
grasp her slender white wrist, his black eyes flashing with entreaty. &ldquo;I
am not like the others of my tribe you see about here; I am more
civilized; I speak your language; I have the last year embraced your
religion. I vowed to you I would not lay hands upon one of your race to
hurt them while you were amongst us. That I have sacredly kept this vow
you well know; but you do not know what it has cost me at times, when I
have seen the bitter cruelty shown by your race toward mine. All this I
would do willingly for you; will you not then be my wife and love me a
little?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Indian spoke with a modesty and manliness so remarkable in a
son of the forest that Millicent was impressed with his manner, and in
her reply tried to show consideration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an exception to your race, Ninigret, and have always acted
honorably toward me. I thank you for all you have done; and, if God ever
restore me to my countrymen, I will show my gratitude in more
substantial form than mere words. Marry you I never can; think of it
calmly, and you will see that it is impossible; such a marriage would
only bring misery to us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You scorn me I see,&rdquo; Ninigret said, quickly, growing angry. &ldquo;I tell you
we should be happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, we should not; from this on you must never mention this subject
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot put me off so easily. What do I care for the kindness you
may show me after you leave here? But you will not leave here very soon,
let me tell you, unless you marry me. In that case you shall escape in a
few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall never escape,&rdquo; replied Millicent, a bright flash of
determination suffusing her fair face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your only answer then is No?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
&ldquo;No; I will never be your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I say you shall. Farewell! We will meet again.&rdquo; And all the latent
savage nature gleamed forth from his face as he swiftly and noiselessly
disappeared into the forest.</p>

<p>Millicent, overcome with emotion, sank listlessly on the ground, where
she remained for some time with her head bowed upon her knees,
regardless of the beauty of the scene about her. Above, the sky was
cloudless, a deep impenetrable blue, as seen through the heavy foliage
of the grand primeval forest. At her feet stretched the calm, smooth
lake, dotted here and there with tiny islands, so thickly wooded that
they looked like escaped bits of the forest floating on the glassy
surface of the water. For miles stretched the line of the shore, here
straight, there gracefully curving, and everywhere heavily overhung by
majestic trees. After a time she raised her eyes, and, stretching her
hand with a hopeless gesture toward the lake, said, &ldquo;Better to drown in
that quiet water than to remain longer with these savages, now that
Ninigret has turned foe also, and I have no friend to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me be a friend to help you,&rdquo; replied a manly voice close by.</p>

<p>Surprised and astonished Millicent sprang to her feet, and saw standing
before her a tall, handsome man of perhaps five and thirty years,
dressed in uniform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O sir! can I really hope that you will help a poor, distressed captive
girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; he answered, moving near to her. &ldquo;First tell me the
circumstances of your captivity and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! do not speak so loud, or they will hear us and take you prisoner
also. Come this way,&rdquo; said Millicent, as she led him to a thick clump of
trees near at hand. &ldquo;A short distance from here, on yonder hill, is an
Indian camp, which has been my home for many months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How large is the encampment?&rdquo; asked the young man, looking with
interest and admiration at the poorly clad but refined and beautiful
girl by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When all are there they number about one hundred; but at present most
of the warriors are away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your home?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have no home. I am an orphan, and with my sister was visiting friends
in Taunton, at the time the Indians attacked that place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Tell me the story of your capture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will if you care to hear it. Upon the breaking out of the war, my
friends, like others, became alarmed, and adopted such means of defence
as they could command; still, when Philip really appeared with his
Indians, they were surprised. Ah, sir, even you, who I see are an
officer, and probably used to such sights, would have been touched by
the misery and desolation those wretches caused on that day. They fired
the house we were in, and when we were driven by the flames to the open
air, they assailed us; and then I saw my friends struck down about me.
An old woman, a mother, three daughters and a son, all brutally killed.
Then they seized me, more dead than alive. A fierce Indian, with a yell,
raised some weapon in the air, while holding me fast with the other
hand; but his uplifted arm was suddenly grasped by a stalwart and gayly
dressed chief, whom I soon learned was King Philip. Although nearly
overcome with terror, I heard him say, &lsquo;She is too&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful to be killed,&rdquo; added the officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I suppose that was the idea. &lsquo;Take her captive.&rsquo; They bound
my arms to my sides and carried me away. I fainted at that point, and
when I came to myself was on horseback, supported by a horrible old
squaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor girl! how did you survive such a shock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, for I was ill with fever throughout the journey; but am
I not wearying you with the history of a girl who has surely no claim
upon you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a claim, dear lady; the unfortunate have always a claim upon
any honorable man; besides, I am deeply interested in your story. Please
proceed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We travelled slowly on for several days, resting at night. The shock,
the mode of life, and, above all, the anxiety about my sister, of whose
fate I knew nothing, made me ill and unfit for the rough journey. When I
failed and fainted, as I did several times, they beat me and knocked me
about, making me walk when utterly unable, as a punishment for my
laziness, they said. At last, when they saw I could go no farther on my
feet, they strapped me on a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
horse&#8217;s back, where I lay, half delirious
and without food, until we reached this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an experience for one so delicate!&rdquo; remarked the officer, looking
at Millicent with increasing interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We arrived here late one night, and then an old squaw, who has ever
since been kind to me, took me to her wigwam and made me as comfortable
as she could. I shall never forget the relief it was to lie quiet, if
only on a bed of pine-boughs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have had fortitude to have lived through such a mental and
physical strain. How did they happen to bring you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That night, when they thought I slept, I overheard the leader of the
band that brought me talking with Wattasacompanum, the chief of the
Nipmucks. He said Philip had ordered them to bring me here, and sent a
message that I should be kept and well treated until he should see fit
to have me ransomed. Wattasacompanum, who is a good chief and a praying
Indian, promised that I should be faithfully guarded. The next day,
before Philip&#8217;s messengers departed, I was carried outside the wigwam,
where the Indians danced a wild, fantastic war-dance about me, to the
music of their own strange screaming. I lay trembling with fright, until
the old squaw came out and sat by me, somewhat quieting my fears by
repeating, &lsquo;They no kill you; they no kill.&rsquo; They wished to paint my
face and decorate my head with branches, but Wattasacompanum said no,
that being ill I should not be disturbed. He laid his hand on my head,
and solemnly promised to safely keep me; and after that the strange
Indians departed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did they do for you to bring back your health?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very little. I was allowed to rest for a time, was not treated very
harshly, and nature did the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What food did you have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that was the worst trial; for days I ate almost nothing. I could
not touch the meat they kept constantly boiling in a great common
kettle, which all could go to, but I soon learned to eat a sort of cake
they make of Indian corn, and when stronger I wandered about and found
berries and dried nuts for myself; but I have never been strong since I
came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That does not surprise me. Such a life for one like you! Have they
always treated you well?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
&ldquo;No, they are often very rough; but the women are kinder than the men,
who, fortunately for me, are away upon the war-path the greater part of
the time, returning only occasionally for a night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What work do they require of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I first bring up water from the lake in the morning,&mdash;that tires me
most,&mdash;then I help cook their food, and do whatever is necessary in an
Indian household,&rdquo;&mdash;and Millicent smiled,&mdash;&ldquo;and I sew for the women and
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wretches! why don&#8217;t they bring their own water from the lake, and
make their own clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would willingly do all they ask could I but know that I may soon be
free to look for my sister, and be among my own race again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will see about that. You must not do drudgery for these savages much
longer. Have you no relatives with whom it may be possible your sister
is now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None; the family whom we were visiting when I was captured were our
only relatives. My sister was out at the time on an errand in the town;
so you see I do not know whether she was killed or captured, undoubtedly
one or the other. My name is Millicent Gordon; hers, Martha. Now, sir,
you have my history, and I wish to thank you for your kind attention. It
has done me good to relate it to you, for you are the first white man
whom I have seen for many months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear lady, your story has interested me deeply and aroused in me
both sincere admiration and sympathy for one who has suffered so much
and so bravely. My one thought is to liberate you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you really do so? Is the country, then, not all given over to the
Indians? Oh, tell me it is not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed; they are being steadily and surely conquered; though, God
knows, they do enough damage even now. I am Captain Merwin, sent here
from Boston on a scouting expedition. I have two men with me, who are
awaiting my return less than a mile off. I wandered in this direction
while they were resting. I knew there were many Indians roving about;
but that there was a camp in this vicinity I was not aware.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They suppose their existence here to be unknown to the whites.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
&ldquo;I wonder they trust you as far as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do; I always return. They know I am unable to escape, and would be
found and brought back if I tried; so they grant me my only solace, that
of wandering in the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time they have trusted you once too often. Will you go with me,
and let me take you back to your friends?&rdquo; asked the captain,
impulsively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would go with you most willingly; but would the venture not be too
rash? Would it not endanger your own safety and that of your men, who
might escape harm alone, but, impeded with a woman, you might lose your
lives while saving hers. No, I had better stay where I am. You can be of
more service without me,&rdquo; answered Millicent, with quiet forethought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for a moment would I consider myself in the matter, Miss Gordon,&rdquo;
replied the captain, with prompt assurance; &ldquo;but perhaps it is not best
to attempt to rescue you until I have secured more men.&rdquo; He remained
silent a few minutes, apparently in deep thought, and said, at last,
very decidedly, &ldquo;No; in case we met even a small band of Indians we
should be unable to resist, and they would surely recapture you or kill
us all at once. If you will have a little patience, and still trust me,
I promise to return and liberate you as soon as I can get men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I trust you wholly; and, as for patience, the hope of rescue will
make it infinite until you come,&rdquo; said Millicent, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for your trust; it shall not be misplaced. Be prepared at any
time after a week for an attack upon the camp, and this time the war-cry
will come from friends instead of enemies. May I do homage to the fair
hand that has carried water to quench the thirst of an Indian squaw?&rdquo;
Before the blushing Millicent could deny the favor he had pressed her
fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must return now, or they will look for me. See, the sun sets
already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go part way with you, as I wish to observe the situation of your
present home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abode, not home,&rdquo; Millicent said, half-jestingly. &ldquo;Yes, come with me,
but tread softly or you may be heard,&rdquo; and she led the way through the
wood. Upon reaching the brow of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
hill she halted, and, placing her
hand on the captain&#8217;s arm, said, &ldquo;Look through these trees into the
clearing yonder.&rdquo; He did so, and saw a number of wigwams, with smoke
curling out from their tops, and, sitting about on the ground outside,
several women, and one or two old men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there you have lived for nearly a year; but it is late; I must
leave you. Be of good courage, and believe that never a crusader felt
his pledge to visit the Holy Land more sacred than I do mine to liberate
you;&rdquo; and, lifting his hat with deference, he withdrew into the forest.</p>

<p>The scene above described carries the reader back to the time of the
fierce and devastating war waged by King Philip against the settlers of
New England, in which all the worst elements of the Indian nature came
to the surface. The firebrand and the tomahawk were the weapons employed
by the Indians to accomplish their purpose of destroying the advancing
power of the white man; and so mercilessly did they use these that the
outposts of civilization were swept away as by a whirlwind. The savages,
avoiding direct conflict with organized forces of the English, made
sudden and unsuspected attacks, under cover of darkness, upon exposed
houses or towns, applying the torch to the buildings, and massacring the
inhabitants or carrying them into captivity. Neither the life nor
property of a white man was safe for an instant. While sitting quietly
by his fireside or working in his cornfield, he was liable to instant
death at the hands of an unseen foe. In such a condition of affairs it
is not surprising that spots, where of late the influence of
civilization had begun to make itself felt, were abandoned by their
terror-stricken inhabitants. Thus, for a while, the rude savages again
appeared as rulers of the land, and the forest often resounded with
their war-cry as they fell on one partly-deserted town after another,
and their yells of triumph rang on the hushes of midnight as they
returned from their fiendish expeditions of plunder waving aloft the
scalps of their victims. For a year or more this bloody war lasted,
bringing death and desolation to many homes, until its guiding hand and
vital breath, King Philip, was struck down, killed by one of his race.</p>

<h2>THE WEBSTER FAMILY.</h2>

<p class="center1">BY HON. STEPHEN M. ALLEN.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>I.</strong></p>


<p>The family of Webster, which settled on the easterly coast of
Massachusetts and New Hampshire, became quite numerous, and emigrated to
the various parts of western New Hampshire as early as 1763. Stephen
Webster was one of the twelve pioneers of the town of Plymouth, N.H., in
which, with other settlers of the backwoods, they had to endure great
privations and hardships.</p>

<p>The three Webster families which settled and remained in Plymouth always
claimed Daniel and Ezekiel of Salisbury as first or second cousins.</p>

<p>I quote from Moore Russell Fletcher, M.D., who was connected with the
Webster family on both sides, the following narration. He says that Mrs.
Stephen Webster and her sons and daughters, the youngest of whom was
Mrs. Betsey Fletcher Webster,&mdash;the mother of the doctor, and who died in
1863, at the advanced age of eighty-one,&mdash;gave him much of his
information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stephen Webster, with eleven others, with their wives and children,
went from Chester, N.H., to Plymouth, N.H., then a wilderness, about
forty-five miles north of Penacook, now Concord, and there, on the
Pemigewasset, near the juncture of Baker&#8217;s River (afterwards so
called), they erected a log-cabin, in that hitherto transient abode of
the wild animals of the forest and the still wilder Indians, who at
intervals passed through the place on their way to Penacook, Contoocook,
Hooksett, Suncook, and Soucook, their old camping-grounds. These men,
having selected lands for farms, had no alternative but to carry on
their backs the articles of food, implements and seeds requisite for
their colonization. They had axes, saws, augers, and shaves, or
drawing-knives, and for protection and food their guns and ammunition;
not forgetting their bibles, hymn-books, and tinder-boxes. In their
journey through the wilderness from Penacook, a distance of sixty or
seventy miles, they were guided
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
by blazes on trees made by surveyors or
men in search of lands, were obliged to cross streams on fallen trees
reaching from bank to bank, and when hunger and fatigue compelled a
halt, they selected a spot near some stream, drew forth their
tinder-boxes, and with steel and flint struck a fire; then they selected
flat stones, wet some Indian meal, placed it on the stones, and baked it
for their frugal meal&mdash;their &lsquo;Johnny-cake.&rsquo; At night they constructed a
little booth of bushes, with their fire at its entrance, and, as they
laid upon the boughs, their feet would be near the fire,&mdash;a great
protection against wild animals who infested the forest and who are
known to have great dread of fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each day was a repetition of its predecessor. Upon their arrival their
first efforts were directed to erecting a temporary wigwam of trees and
bushes in their new home, and all reposed on the boughs, prior to which
all joined in prayer and thanksgiving for their safe arrival and good
health. On the morrow, after locating the spot for buildings, they began
the erection of their log-houses, with one room, with opening for light,
and an attic, which was accessible by a small ladder. The crevices
between the logs were stopped with moss; the floor of the rooms, roofs,
and the attics and doors were of small poles. A few days were sufficient
to get their houses in the rough well under way. For food all had equal
rights and took an equal part in procuring it. Three or four took dog
and gun, and in an hour or two returned with a dead moose, bear, or
three or four deer on their shoulders. They subsisted largely upon game,
which was plenty in the forest, and when a change was desired they
sought fish, with which the streams abounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few months after their arrival, Mrs. Stephen Webster signified her
expectation of adding another member to her family. It was a matter
deemed of such importance that a town meeting was called, a moderator
and clerk chosen, and the vote put to the meeting upon the name which
should be given to the new-comer, which vote was unanimous &lsquo;if a boy his
name shall be Plymouth.&rsquo; But their vote did not prevent its being a
girl, and she was called Lydia, with the remark, &lsquo;the first white child
born in Plymouth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon one occasion, food being nearly exhausted, a settler took a bag,
went to Concord, got one hundred pounds of Indian meal, took it on his
shoulder, and carried it to Plymouth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
sleeping on boughs, and baking
his corn-cake on a flat stone. His arrival was hailed with enthusiasm.
When tired of moose and bear meat they tried deer, rabbit, coon, and
turtle, then turned to salmon, eels, and pouts. For dessert they had
chestnuts, beech-nuts, and butternuts, and for drink they used the
checkerberry and hardhack, but mostly they used mountain tea and swamp
chocolate-root; these two last-named articles nearly resembled those
brought from foreign countries. They raised flax, and with it made their
clothing for both men and women. For coats and outer garments they
doubled and redoubled the threads, the cloth resembling our present
canvas. Linen was found to be cold for stockings and socks, and their
inventive talent was brought into use. They cut hair from the bear-skins
and mixed it with tow, and thus Bruin furnished them meat, cotton, and
wool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a few years of roughing it the settlers began to reckon on some
of the luxuries of civilization, and indulged in windows, each allowing
two panes of glass 7 X 9. Their fireplaces and chimneys were built of
flat stones for the first few feet, and were &lsquo;topped out&rsquo; with clay,
mixed with straw, and held by sticks of wood laid up cob-house fashion.
The same kind of chimney may now be seen in the rural districts of
Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. In many places the fireplace and
chimney stand outside of the house, and the fireplace is wide enough to
burn wood ten feet long. The wood requires but little chopping or
splitting. For andirons they used large stones. When the children wanted
to warm themselves they stood at the corner at the ends of the wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They made their furniture, hewing planks from logs for tables, and for
a tub chopped off the end of a log, dug a hole through it, leaving only
a shell, in which, with a jackknife, they made a groove for the bottom,
which also was hewn from a piece of log. The shell of their tub was then
soaked with hot water, to enlarge its circle; the plank bottom was then
crowded into the groove, and the tub dried before the fire. If not
water-tight, the openings were filled with rags. For chairs they took
tops of trees with many limbs, split them into two parts, and the limbs
answered for legs. Their crockery, much of it, was made of hard wood:
from knarls they made trays, bowls, pans, plates, and sometimes spoons,
knives, and forks. Instead of candles they used pitch and candle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> woods.
My grandfather, had in his house wooden trays, bowls, plates, and wooden
spoons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the number of inhabitants had increased so that it was called a
village, earthen plates and pewter plates and iron spoons were brought
into town from the town and larger settlements. Men carried the flax
wheel on their backs, and their mechanical skill enabled them to
construct looms.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;As the settlement increased in number, and the people began felling
trees, the Indians, who from time to time passed there on their way to
Penacook, Contoocook, Hooksett, etc., seeing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
whites encroaching
upon their lands, began their maraudings and became so troublesome, that
the settlers regarded it as no sin to kill a redskin who was known to
watch about for an opportunity to secretly send an arrow with deadly
intent at their white brothers whenever they ventured beyond the limits
of their little settlement.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;There was one, Mr. Baker, whose delight was, we learned of the
Indians,&mdash;being at their camping-ground, near the union of what is now
Baker&#8217;s River with the Pemigewasset River, about a mile above
Plymouth,&mdash;to take his gun, as he termed it, and play hide-and-seek with
the redskins. His scouting about would seem to be known, and an Indian
would come out to spy his enemy, hiding from tree to tree. Baker did the
same, and as each peeped for the other Baker placed his hat on the
muzzle of his gun, and held it so that the Indian saw, as he thought, a
white man&#8217;s head. Then he sent an arrow whizzing through Baker&#8217;s old
hat, and, seeing it fall, stepped out to finish his foe by raising the
hair, when Baker sent a slug through the redskin. Soon another Indian
came peeping from trees to learn the cause of that report and the fate
of his chief. In a few minutes Baker played the same game on him and
several others. Baker became so notorious an Indian exterminator that
they gave the river his name; hence Baker&#8217;s River.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE NEW ENGLAND LIBRARY AND ITS FOUNDER.</h2>

<p class="center1">BY VICTORIA REED.</p>


<p>Thomas Prince was an eminent divine and accomplished scholar, well known
throughout New England during the first half of the 18th century. His
life is worthy of consideration on many accounts, but particularly for
the great work he accomplished outside of his profession. He is,
perhaps, best known to this generation as the collector of the Prince
Library, now incorporated with many other private collections in the
Public Library of Boston, although his published work, &ldquo;The Chronology
of New England,&rdquo; confers an equal benefit on posterity, and both
together entitle him to a place of honor in our annals.</p>

<p>His library was gathered as much for the instruction of others as for
his own gratification. It is interesting to know that this bequest, now
one hundred and fifty years old, obsolete in some respects, is still
highly valued. Some writer says, that, if for no other reason, there
should be a new fire-proof building for the Public Library for the
better preservation of the Shakespeare collection and the Prince
Library. The valuable editions of Shakespeare arranged in glass cases in
the Bates Hall are no doubt familiar to many people, but it is possible
that the majority even of the daily visitors to this institution have no
definite knowledge of the Prince Library, which is found, on
examination, to contain a fund for the curious, as well as many things
of importance to the antiquarian.</p>

<p>This library was added to the Public Library twenty-four years ago, and
was originally a gift to the Old South Church. It is a collection which
should be treasured, not only by Bostonians and all New England people,
but is also of importance to the country at large, as it was, in a
limited sense, the forerunner of all public libraries in the land. It is
of a twofold nature,&mdash;an historical section, with the other devoted to
ecclesiastical works. Mr. Prince designed the ecclesiastical or Old
South collection, as he called it, for the use of the pastors and church
of which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
was associate pastor forty years. This contained all the
Latin and Greek books, and all in oriental languages.</p>

<p>His will states: &ldquo;That whereas I have been many years collecting a
number of books, pamphlets, maps, prints and manuscripts, either
published in New England or pertaining to its history and public
affairs, to which collection I have given the name of &lsquo;Ye New England
Library,&rsquo; and have deposited in the steeple of the Old South Church; and
as I made this collection from a public view and desire that many
important transactions might be remembered, which otherwise would be
lost, I hereby bequeath the collection to the Old South Church forever,
to the end that this collection may be kept entire. I desire that this
collection be kept in a different department from the other books, and
that it may be so made that no person shall borrow any book or paper
therefrom, but that any person whom the pastors and deacons of the
church for the time being shall approve, may have access thereto, and
take copies therefrom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince catalogue states that, &ldquo;at his death, the New England Library
was the most extensive of the kind that had ever been formed. It
contains, in its depleted state, not less than 1,500 books and tracts
relating to America during the period of our colonial history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mather family and Gov. Hutchinson are alone to be compared with Mr.
Prince as collectors of books, and theirs avail little, as they have
been scattered and destroyed. It is a matter of congratulation that the
greater portion of Mr. Prince&#8217;s books have been preserved, each of which
had been carefully selected, &ldquo;many bearing name, date of purchase, cost,
and place where it was acquired.&rdquo; He frequently noted contemporaneous
events of public importance on fly-leaf.</p>

<p>A great number were purchased during a seven-years&#8217; residence in Europe,
and some one says, &ldquo;By means of this memoranda, we can easily trace the
stages of his sojourn abroad.&rdquo; He invented a very quaint book-plate,
with flowered border, in which he inscribed his name.</p>

<p>Many valuable books and manuscripts were destroyed at the beginning of
hostilities, which resulted in the Revolutionary war. The library, when
entire, was a rare monument to the energy and perseverance of Mr.
Prince, who, through a long and laborious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
life, never lost sight of
this cherished project of his youth. It has never been merged into any
other collection, but remains entirely separate, in accordance with the
will of the testator. It has a special catalogue, and no book is ever
taken from the building, though accessible for reference in the main
hall. The books are deposited in an alcove at the top of the house,
reached by a spiral stairway. Many of them are of immense size, in heavy
leather bindings, while others are of the smallest dimensions. The pages
are yellow with age, and the majority will have only the ravages of time
to contend with, as the contents are not of a nature to make them
attractive to the youth, or even to many maturer minds of this
generation; but to the antiquarian, and as a picture of the growth of a
mind in Puritan days, from its earliest years to advanced age, this
collection is unequalled; for it was carefully selected, subject to the
taste and needs of Mr. Prince&#8217;s nature, and each book was familiar and
favorite ground to him.</p>

<p>The first book with date bears this inscription: &ldquo;Thos. Prince, his
book, 1697, 10 years of age.&rdquo; The book was &ldquo;Marrow of Modern Divinity,&rdquo;
with &ldquo;Awakening Call to the Unconverted&rdquo; attached, and in his 16th year
the following book was added: &ldquo;Some Account of Holy Life and Death of
Mr. Henry Gearing, late citizen of London, who departed this life Jan.
4th, 1693, aged 61. Boston in New England, printed for Sam&#8217;l Phillips,
at the Brick Shop, 1704.&rdquo; Underneath is written, &ldquo;Anno Domini, 1704,
Thomas Prince, Duke of Landwich, Earl of Pen<sup>a</sup>pog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The taking down of the first Old South and &ldquo;Ye day of laying foundation
of y<sup>e</sup> South Church, New Meeting House, March 31, 1727,&rdquo; are duly
chronicled in books of those dates. All through his life Thomas Prince
showed a wonderful adaptability in noting the minutest as well as
greatest events, and we trace a thorough command of detail in his
published work, both lay and clerical. This, joined with enthusiasm and
unflagging zeal, caused him to master all difficulties, and to
accomplish tasks that would be appalling to an untrained or
undisciplined mind.</p>

<p>One of the cards used for reference in the Public Library contains the
following: &ldquo;The Prince Library has some rare specimens of the earliest
typographical art in British America, and other books of peculiar
interest in the history of New England, though not printed in America.
The Bay Psalm Book, which was printed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
at Cambridge, Mass., in 1640,
being the first book ever printed in the British Possessions, &lsquo;The
Freeman&#8217;s Oath&rsquo; and a small almanac only preceding it. What is supposed
to be the original draught of the preface of this book, in the
handwriting of one of the editors, the Rev. Richard Mather, is among the
Prince MSS. Elliot&#8217;s Indian Bible,&mdash;first edition printed at Cambridge,
1663,&mdash;also Eliot&#8217;s Indian Primer, 1720, in original binding, and
thought in that style to be unique. Capt. John Smith&#8217;s description of
New England, printed in London, 1616, with the early map. This copy
contains the old and new names, and has differences from most copies
that have been preserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Prince collected the original manuscripts of the &ldquo;Mather Papers,&rdquo;
and arranged them chronologically with notes. He seemed to know
intuitively that everything should be preserved that would be of the
least advantage to future historians. The salvation of the records of
this most important family, who, with extreme rigor and cruelty even, in
some cases, ruled the Puritans of their day, was a natural and
thoughtful act on Mr. Prince&#8217;s part.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Hinckley Papers&rdquo; are of great interest also. The catalogue of this
portion of the library has been very carefully prepared, as each letter
in all these manuscript collections is designated by subject, the name
of the writer, date, and volume that contains it. The Hinckley papers
were those belonging to Mr. Prince&#8217;s maternal grandfather, Gov.
Hinckley, who had a very extensive correspondence during the twenty
years he was governor of Plymouth Colony. It contains letters from all
men of note of that period,&mdash;Roger Williams, the Cottons, the Mathers,
Gov. Winslow, a letter of King Charles II. to Gov. Josiah Winslow, Gov.
Hinckley&#8217;s address, and petition to James II.; also many personal
letters to wife and daughters. Mr. Prince says &ldquo;that on his
grandfather&#8217;s death he took these papers from his study, but while he
was in Europe some of curiosity and value were unhappily lost.&rdquo; There
are some Prince papers, mostly letters of distinguished divines to his
brother, Rev. Nathan Prince. In his brother&#8217;s commonplace book he
inscribes, &ldquo;This book belongs to the New England Library. Begun to be
collected by Thomas Prince upon his entering Harvard College in 1703,
and was given by Prince to s&#8217;d library in memory of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
late dear
brother, y<sup>e</sup> Rev. Nathan Prince, M.A., formerly Fellow and Tutor of
Harvard College. Born at Sandwich, November, 1698; died at Rattan, 1748,
and wrote this manuscript before he left s<sup>d</sup> college in 1742.&rdquo; The
catalogue remarks: &ldquo;Two vols. MSS., evidently companions to this book,
are in the Library of Bishop of London at Fulham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is in the Prince Library quite a large collection of
ecclesiastical history and biblical literature.</p>

<p>The psalms in numberless versions, metres, and paraphrases, in Hebrew,
Latin, and Greek; one hundred and six volumes on natural, polemic, and
practical theology. All his own works are to be found here; as many as
thirty-three sermons, mostly funeral discourses, others commemorating
great events, such as victories at Culloden and Louisburg. He gave
frequently the genealogy of the person eulogized in his funeral
orations, thus making them valuable for family reference, and often of
historical significance. We easily trace the early bent of his mind
toward chronology. It gathered force throughout his whole career, and
finally bore fruit in his own &ldquo;Chronology of New England,&rdquo; on which he
spent many years of preparation.</p>

<p>He said himself, when he presented it in person to the House, of which
Hon. Mr. Quincy was speaker, in 1736: &ldquo;I most humbly present to your
honor, and this honorable house, the first volume of my &lsquo;Chronology of
New England,&rsquo; which at no small expense and pains I have composed and
published for the instruction and good of my country.&rdquo; He published
three parts of the second volume, and made elaborate preparations for
its continuance. He began his work at the patriarchal period, and
brought it down with careful attention to reliable facts into the
earliest annals and descriptive history of Plymouth Colony, throwing
light on the mode of living and thinking of the Puritans by copious
quotations from their diaries. If his diligent and inquisitive mind
could have completed this wonderful production,&mdash;bringing it to the
middle of the 18th century,&mdash;it would have been such a perfect and
minute account of the early history of New England that there would
have been nothing for later historians to glean. It was, however,
unappreciated at the time of its publication, which was a discouragement
to him, though he always maintained, with his peculiar insight into the
needs of coming ages, that the time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
would surely arrive when his
patient and laborious work would meet with some reward,&mdash;a prophecy
which has been more than fulfilled as far as the historians of New
England are concerned.</p>

<p>The last work of his busy life was the revision of the Bay Psalm Book.
Mr. Prince, in his account of this undertaking, gives an idea of the
thoroughness of his preparatory work. He says: &ldquo;The old Psalm Book,&mdash;the
first book printed in all North America, or in the New World,&mdash;this
version of 1640, by the clergymen, John Elliot, of Roxbury, Mr. Richard
Mather, of Dorchester, and Mr. Thomas Weld,&mdash;was liked so much, that it
was used by some congregations in England while I was there.&rdquo; &ldquo;To gain
sentiment,&rdquo; he says, for his own version, &ldquo;I read every verse in English
Bible and Polyglot; also in Hebrew, with Moulane&#8217;s Interlineary, the
Septuagint, the Chaldee, the ancient Latin, Latin versions of Syriac and
Arabic, Castalio, Tremilius and Junius, Ainsworth and De Mies. When I
met with difficulty I searched the following ancient lexicons:
Avenarius, Schindler, Pagnini, Mercer, Buxtorfs two lexicons, namely,
Hebrew and Chaldaic, Leigh, Castillus, Bythun, and Martin Albert.&rdquo; There
were also various interpretations from another long list of names; while
he looked into New England version for groundwork, he compared with
twelve metrical versions.</p>

<p>A contemporary says: &ldquo;It showed his wonderful industry and remarkable
scholarship.&rdquo; His professional labors throughout fifty years were very
arduous, but he brought the same careful preparation into all branches
of his daily occupations that we find in his published work. In addition
to his theological studies, which were naturally absorbing, and his
historical research, he was thoroughly conversant with polite
literature. At his death his library, which he had deposited in the
belfry of the Old South Church, said to be his study, remained there
intact and undisturbed for seventeen years. The books were on shelves,
the manuscripts and maps in boxes and barrels. At the breaking out of
the Revolutionary war they were still left where Mr. Prince placed them,
though the old meeting-house became the camping ground of British
soldiery. Pews and pulpit were burnt, to enable the riding school&mdash;which
the soldiers inaugurated&mdash;a better opportunity for its operations. Gov.
Winthrop&#8217;s old residence, next door to the church, opposite the foot of
School street, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
had been used some time as a parsonage, fell a
victim to the lawlessness of the soldiers, who used the beams and
rafters of this memento of the earliest Puritan days for firewood, while
many of Mr. Prince&#8217;s books and manuscripts were immolated on the same
altar. It has been suggested that some were taken by the spectators who
thronged to witness the exhibitions, as manuscripts known to have
belonged to this library were found&mdash;so the catalogue states&mdash;as remote
as in a grocer&#8217;s shop in Nova Scotia. It would be difficult to
conjecture which would have caused the greater grief to Mr. Prince,&mdash;the
desecration of the church, whose construction had been a daily delight,
and where he had earnestly labored for so many years, or the sacrifice
of a portion of the results of the patient toil of a lifetime. This
material, however, which was consigned to the flames, would have been of
great benefit to historical societies, who now treasure the minutest
facts that bear upon our past history. In 1814, when society had
recovered its equilibrium, and began to feel a dawning pride in the
great achievement that made of the colonies a free and independent
nation, an interest naturally increased in those things that pertained
to their earliest chronicles. The Historical Society looked over the
books and pamphlets belonging to Mr. Prince, removing the historical
portion to their rooms, while the ecclesiastical was sent to the house
of the pastor of the Old South. In 1860 it was considered desirable to
place them all together in the Public Library of Boston, where they
would be under the guardianship of the city, and be far more accessible,
though still the property of the Old South.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to conspire to make the life of Thomas Prince an
exceptionally happy and fortunate one. He had remarkable opportunities
from his birth to develop all his natural capabilities, and in spite of
his Puritan surroundings he gained a liberal view of life, and
appreciated and profited by the facilities for culture that were open to
him. He traced himself the genealogy and characteristics of the Prince
family, and we find in him the modified traits of his English and
Puritan forefathers, who, though strictly religious, were not so
fanatical as many about them. His great-grandfather, the Rev. John
Prince, who lived in the reign of James I. and Charles I., was educated
at Oxford, and became rector of East Shefford, Berkshire, Eng. Thomas Prince
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
says of him: &ldquo;Of whom there was this remarkable, that he was one
of the Puritan ministers of the Church of England who in part conformed
and who greatly longed for a further reformation. He had married a
daughter of Dr. Toldenburg, D.D., of Oxford, by whom he had four sons
and seven daughters. Every one of the children proved conscientious
non-conformists even while their parents lived, without any breach of
affection. Thus they continued pretty near together until the furious
and cruel Archbishop Laud dispersed and drove their eldest son, with
many others, to this country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter Money, F.S.A., local secretary of Berks, writes of the old church
at East Shefford, of which Rev. John Prince was rector from 1620 to
1644: &ldquo;The church where he preached still stands, being used only for a
mortuary chapel, a new one for use having been erected near by. The old
chapel is a most interesting building of the time of Henry VIII., and
considered worthy to be described in full in arch&aelig;ological works found
in the British Museum. It contains a remarkable monument of Sir Thomas
Fettiplace and his wife Beatrice, whose old manor-house adjoined the
church. There is an exquisite view of the latter in the British Museum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rector&#8217;s oldest son, also named John, was destined for the ministry,
and had been three years at Oxford before coming to this country. On
arriving here, thinking his preparatory work too meagre for his
profession, he devoted himself to husbandry. He settled in Hull, in
1633. His son Samuel, the father of Thomas, was born in 1649, and his
son chronicles of him, &ldquo;That he was healthy and strong in body, vigorous
and active in spirit, thoughtful and religious from youth, esteemed for
his abilities and gifts, especially of his power of arguing; a zealous
asserter of New England liberties, with charity to others, instructive
in conversation.&rdquo; He represented the town of Sandwich nineteen times in
legislative councils. He had two wives; the second was Mercy, daughter
of Governor Hinckley, and Thomas was her oldest son. Governor Hinckley
was a man of superior ability, distinguished in the history of Plymouth
Colony. &ldquo;He had been from first to last the associate, in weal or woe,
of its great and good men, and had lived himself chief among the
survivors to see the last chapter written in its immortal annals.&rdquo; His
grandmother Hinckley was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
daughter of Quartermaster Smith, who came
from England. Her grandson, Thomas Prince, says of her: &ldquo;To the day of
her death she shone in the eyes of all as the loveliest and brightest
for beauty, knowledge, wisdom, majesty, accomplishments and graces
throughout the colony.&rdquo; Governor Hinckley had seventeen children, their
names corresponding to the spirit of the times. Among them we find
Mataliah, Mehitable, Mercy, Experience, Thankful, Reliance, Ebenezer,
and Bathsheba. Thomas Prince himself, one of fourteen children, was born
at Sandwich, the first town settled on the Cape in 1687. When eleven
years old he went to his grandfather Hinckley&#8217;s, and remained with him
until he entered college. Here he imbibed his taste for chronology and
his love of books. His grandfather fostered him in his youthful ambition
of founding a library, and gave him many from his own collection. During
his long life of eighty years Governor Hinckley became thoroughly
acquainted with all events of importance that had happened in the new
world, and the eager boy was fed and stimulated by companionship with
him, and all the moving spirits of the day who frequented his
grandfather&#8217;s house. His early attention to religious subjects, his wide
culture, and remarkable sympathy with everything pertaining to his own
times, was the blossoming fruit instilled into him by an honorable
ancestry, who from the early part of the seventeenth century had been
consistent Puritans, and filled places of trust with honor and fidelity.</p>

<p>Although in the first half of the eighteenth century religious
fanaticism was on the decline in Europe it held sway still, in a
measure, in the colonies. There had been many instances of intolerance
and tyranny on the part of the clergy in the past. Cotton Mather&#8217;s
implacable spirit found vent in the superstition and cruelty that
characterized the Salem Witchcraft, while other ministerial leaders were
prominent in the persecution of the Quakers. Joseph Sewall and Thomas
Prince were educated under the Cottons and Mathers, but their lives
presented a striking contrast to these fiery expounders of the Christian
faith. Tolerance, benevolence, and humility shone conspicuously in their
united careers. The serious character of the books collected and read by
young Prince from his tenth year shows not only his daily training, but
the inherent tendency of his mind toward that profession which he
afterwards adorned. Mr. Sewall, his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
colleague, says of him, &ldquo;That his
crowning glory was that he was pious from his youth.&rdquo; He entered Harvard
College at sixteen, and, after graduating, devoted two years to the
study of divinity in Cambridge. His acquirements in theology, science,
and history were marvellous, and, with his diligence and love of
research, he turned with great energy to Europe as a wider field, where
he could add indefinitely to his already fine attainments, and where the
ease and grace of an older civilization left their stamp on his future
deportment and endeared him to his people and the whole community. In
1709 he sailed for England by the way of Barbadoes, thence to Madeira,
and, after another trip to Barbadoes, he finally settled in England in
October, 1710, making his home there seven years. There is one volume of
his journal covering this period, bound in vellum, at the Massachusetts
Historical rooms, presented by the Rev. Chandler Robbins. It is a
miracle of neatness and precision, but in such fine penmanship that it
is difficult to decipher. His love of detail is manifest in the most
accurate information in regard to the ship&#8217;s progress in her various
voyages; and in his account of the small-pox and measles, both of which
diseases assailed him at this time, the daily symptoms were chronicled
in the most vivid manner. He attended theological lectures in London and
at various universities, becoming in 1711 pastor of a church in Combs,
Suffolk County, England. For six years this young American pursued his
profession with enthusiasm, in the midst of a population who were
devoted to him. Before returning to America he formed a church at
Battisford, next parish to Combs, and when he returned to his native
land many of his congregation came with him.</p>

<p>The chapel was then closed; one part of the flock settled at Needham
Market, the other at Stowmarket,&mdash;these churches still existing. In
Combs began the romantic period of his life. He became interested in
Deborah Denny, a child of twelve when he came to the village, who grew
up under his ministrations. Her family for centuries was famed for its
piety and was thoroughly devoted to the interests of the church. Her
training had been as strict in religious matters as Mr. Prince&#8217;s. In her
eighteenth year Deborah sailed for America, with her brother Samuel, to
join another brother, who had settled here previously. Mr. Prince took
passage on the same vessel, and two years later they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> married at
the house of her brother, Daniel Denny, at Leicester, by Rev. Joseph
Sewall, Mr. Prince being ten years older than his bride. He had been
urged to continue his residence abroad; but his longings for home were
too powerful for their inducements, and later in life he was known to
have regretted spending so many years away from what he then had learned
to consider his true sphere of usefulness.</p>

<p>He landed in Boston on a July Sunday, 1717. He notes it thus in his
journal: &ldquo;The captain sent his pinnace to carry me up. I landed at Long
Wharf about three quarters of an hour before the meeting began, and by
that means escaped the crowds of people, five hundred it was said, who
came down on the wharf at noon, inquiring for me. But now, the streets
being clear, I silently went up to the Old South Meeting House, where no
one knew me but Mr. Sewall, in the pulpit.&rdquo; The churches of Hingham,
Bristol, and the Old South gave him urgent calls to become their pastor.
His choice fell upon the Old South, whose pastor, Mr. Sewall, was a
cherished friend and classmate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grace Denny, Mrs. Prince&#8217;s mother, in her letters to &ldquo;daughter
Prince,&rdquo; regretted that she was to be subject to the temptations of a
city life, fearing it would be a snare and hindrance to her growth in
grace, and advocated the choice of Hingham as a residence. In 1719
Boston was a goodly town of only twelve thousand inhabitants, governed
with strict Puritan laws, some of which were even oppressive, giving
small opportunity to indulge in the frivolities of life, even if one
desired, and least of all to a pastoress of the Old South Church.</p>

<p>The church in which Mr. Prince was ordained by Increase and Cotton
Mather, and Mr. Sewall, and where he delivered his own ordination sermon
to admiring crowds, was not the historical structure of the present day,
although it occupied the same site. The street in front was lined with
beautiful mulberry trees, and bore the name of &lsquo;Marlboro&rsquo;, from the
great Duke and General. The parsonage was next door north, and opposite,
on Milk street, was the home of Josiah Franklin, where Benjamin was
born. There were handsome residences in the vicinity, and the streets
even then were paved with cobble-stones.</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Wisner, on the one-hundredth anniversary of the erection of the
present Old South, gave a pleasing account of the lives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
and work of
Joseph Sewall and Thomas Prince. He said, &ldquo;Forty years these excellent
men associated and labored for this congregation, in firm friendship, in
perfect unity, which few can emulate. Their journals show never a shadow
of difference. They had remarkable tempers. Mr. Sewall notes in his
journal that he and Mr. Prince always prayed together before their
different church services, and occasionally spent portions of a day
mutually devoted to private humiliation in united prayer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The present meeting-house was erected in 1729. A day was set apart &ldquo;to
humble themselves before God, for all their unfruitfulness under the
means of grace enjoyed in the old meeting-house, and to bless the
building of another one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Sewall prayed with the workmen before they began to take down the
house. It is curious to note the remarkable faith in direct answer to
prayer in those days. President Dwight lays emphasis upon the fact, and
gives the following instance in the life of Mr. Prince as evidence: &ldquo;It
was the destruction of the French fleet, under Duke D&#8217;Anville, in 1746.
Forty ships of war, destined for the destruction of New England, were
fitted out at Brest for the purpose. Our pious fathers, apprised of the
danger, called a meeting for fasting and prayer. While Mr. Prince was
officiating and praying most devoutly to God to avert the calamity, a
sudden gust of wind arose (the day had been perfectly calm and clear),
so violent as to cause a loud clattering of the windows. The reverend
pastor paused in his prayer, and, looking around upon the congregation
with a countenance of hope, he again commenced, and with great
devotional ardor supplicated the Almighty to cause that wind to
frustrate the object of our enemies, and save the country from conquest
and popery. A tempest ensued, in which a greater part of the French
fleet was wrecked on the coast of Nova Scotia. The Duke D&#8217;Anville
committed suicide. Many died with disease, and thousands were consigned
to a watery grave. The small number who survived returned to France,
broken in health and spirits,&mdash;the enterprise was abandoned, and never
renewed.&rdquo; Many who were present have left accounts of Mr. Prince&#8217;s
earnestness on this occasion.</p>

<p>Probably no two men could be more devoted to the religious interests of
their church and the community at large than these, yet Mr. Prince
records, eighteen years after the beginning of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
pastorate, that the
ministers of Boston made an extraordinary effort to arrest the decay of
godliness, but with no abiding results, and this was particularly
noticeable in his own congregation. There seemed to be no change in this
respect until the coming of Whitfield, in 1740, when he preached &ldquo;to
breathless thousands in the old South Church.&rdquo; Mr. Prince welcomed this
apostle with enthusiasm. His own sermons were full of vigor, and a
brilliant imagination embellished them with abundant illustrations, but
depth of thought and zealous research made the majority of his writings
far above the comprehension of the multitude. His printed funeral
sermons are quaint in their deep, black borders, with drawings of
death&#8217;s heads similar to those that adorned the tombstones. His sermon
after the death of George I. may have embodied the feeling prevalent at
that time; but, in view of the more critical light thrown upon the
character and reigns of the Georges by historians and satirists of our
day, this eulogy is a curiosity, with its almost childish enthusiasm and
simple-hearted loyalty. The following are passages from his sermon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>For my part, I shall never forget the joy that swelled my heart
when in the Splendid Procession, at his Coronation, preceded by all
the nobles of the kingdom and his son and heir-apparent, one other
hope, with their Ermine Robes and Coronets, that Royal face at
length appeared, which Heaven had in that moment sent to save these
Great Nations from the Brink of Ruin. Nor do I speak of it as my
case alone, but as what appeared to be the equal transport of the
multitudes around me. The tears of joy seemed to rise and swell in
every eye, and we were hardly able to give a shout thro&#8217; the
laboring passions that were swelling in us. He was in some respects
a Father to the Kings of the earth, or at least a powerful and
decisive mediator and umpire among them. The eyes of the greatest
princes were turned to him. In these distant parts of his Dominion
we have felt the happy influences of his happy reign. He was the
darling and protection of his people, the great support of the
reformed interest and the arbiter of Europe. George II. is a Prince
of winning countenance and manly aspect, had considerable treasure
of useful learning, and with him a most amiable Princess, the
reigning glory of her sex for beauty, knowledge, wit, discretion,
the sweetest temper, the most cheerful, affable and engaging
countenance and carriage, with every charming virtue; in the bloom
of her youth preferred her chaste religion to all the glories of
the Imperial family, and became the love and admiration of every
protestant.</p></div>

<p>President Cheney says of Mr. Prince &ldquo;he may be justly characterized as
one of our great men;&rdquo; but he deplored that he sometimes devoted so much
attention to minute and trifling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
circumstances of things, and gave too
great credit to surprising stories. This, no doubt, may at times have
been unnecessary, and would certainly be a failing at the present time,
when writing on all subjects is so universal; but in Mr. Prince&#8217;s case
it took the form of an advantage to posterity, as this love of detail
caused him to hand down to all generations the most life-like
descriptions of daily life and conversation of his own and remote times.
Although he saw a particular providence in every act, every word, every
wind that blew, and every storm that arose, yet Mr. Sewall said of him,
&ldquo;that the great truths and doctrines of the Gospel were his chosen
subjects. He spake as the oracles of God, as one that felt the Divine
Excellence. Some of his discourses even have received impressions in
England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great tenderness of his nature was particularly prominent in his
family relations. He trained his children in the paths of knowledge, his
well-disciplined mind making him a safe and wise teacher; while, like
him, they were pious from their youth. His only son graduated with honor
from his own college, and had just started on a literary career with
flattering success, when consumption caused his death, in his
twenty-fourth year. Two daughters, also, at the early ages of twenty and
twenty-two, were taken from the household, and in their old age one
daughter only was left to these parents. Mr. Prince&#8217;s contemporaries
speak of his wonderful resignation at these repeated afflictions. His
sermon on the death of his daughter Deborah gives the religious
experience of a young girl who, in those rigorous Calvinistic days, had
her sweet young life overshadowed by the terror of God&#8217;s wrath for what
she considered her unbelief. A few extracts will give a good idea of Mr.
Prince&#8217;s impassioned, pathetic, and even dramatic style, and his
apparently &ldquo;trifling details&rdquo; add vividness to the picture. His son
besought him to dispense with the custom of a funeral oration in his
case; but the feelings of the father were sacrificed to what he
considered his duty to the youth of his congregation on the occasion of
his daughter&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>He said: &ldquo;You have known her character; I need not give it to this
assembly, and I am more especially restrained, not only by my near
relation, but by what she said to me, with all the emotions of a grieved
heart, three or four days before her death. &lsquo;Dear father, I have been
told you speak to people in my commendation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
I beg you would not. I am
a poor, miserable sinner; you cannot think how it grieves me.&rsquo; On these
accounts I must forbear her character; but because God&#8217;s dealings with
her, both before and in her sickness, have been remarkable, I cannot but
think it will be for his glory and your advantage to present some of
them to you. As she grew up, God was pleased to refrain her from
vanities, move her to study her Bible and best of authors, both of
history and divinity. Dr. Watts and Mrs. Rowe&#8217;s writings were familiar
to her. The spirit of God worked upon her at fourteen, but she did not
join the church until two years later, when she narrowly escaped
drowning, in her father&#8217;s bosom. For, as I had just received her in my
arms, in a boat, in order to go on board a vessel in the harbor, bound
to her Uncle Denny&#8217;s, at Georgetown, on the Kennebec river, the boat
steered off, and I fell back with her into the salt water, ten feet
deep, with which she was almost filled, and we both continued under it,
out of sight of her brother and sister looking on, for about a minute.
If a couple of strangers from Connecticut had not been near at hand to
reach her quickly, in a minute or more she had been past recovery....</p>

<p>&ldquo;In all weathers she sought the house of God, and she was afraid of
being deceived. Though her jealousies and fears were troublesome, I
think they were useful. Sometimes she had light and comfort; oftener
otherwise. In her twentieth year she had a fever, and from the first she
thought she should not live, complained of her stupidity of mind,
impenitence and unbelief. I came home from afternoon exercise, found her
so ill that her mother thought herself obliged to tell her, upon which
she thanked her for her kindness, but quickly fell into great distress
on being unprepared for eternity. It would break a heart of stone to
hear her: &lsquo;Oh! dear sir, what shall I do?&rsquo; ... Oh! the horrors of that
night. It was one of the most distressing I ever knew. She wouldn&#8217;t
close her eyes for fear of dying. In the morning was a little more
resigned, fell asleep, awoke refreshed, but still in darkness. &lsquo;Oh! dear
father,&rsquo; she would say, &lsquo;I have dreadfully apostatized from Christ.&rsquo; Mr.
Sewall and I labored with her for days, but we found nobody but the
Almighty could do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Sewall said, &lsquo;If she died in darkness, we should have good ground
to hope that she would awake in glory.&rsquo; To everything he would say she
would reply, &lsquo;I cannot believe.&rsquo; You must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
sensible of a distressed
father&#8217;s heart, putting his soul in her soul&#8217;s place for many weeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Incessant prayers were offered for her in public and private, by
relations and friends who loved her, but until the last half hour of her
life were unanswered. She was in agonies of death all the while Mr.
Sewall was praying. When he and the physician left, I told her they
could do nothing more. She was calm and composed, but did not speak....
It was so dismal to see her depart in darkness. Oh! the distress in that
room. I held her in my arms, she opened her eyes and spoke a new
language: &lsquo;Oh! I love the Lord with all my heart. I see such an
amiableness in him, I prize him above a thousand worlds.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Dear
child, what have you to say to me?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! sir, that you may be more
fervent in your ministry, in exhorting and expostulating with sinners.&rsquo;
I never saw such a change in a sick room, from distress to joy when I
reported her words. I could scarcely have thought a father, mother,
brother and sister could have been so transported in the expiring
moments of one so dear to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This discourse was published in Edinboro&#8217; after his death. His daughter
Sarah, afterwards wife of Lieut.-Gov. Gill, survived her parents a few
years, but died, without children in 1771. She was also deeply
religious, and some of her writings were published in Edinboro&#8217; after
her death.</p>

<p>Mr. Prince&#8217;s life, aside from his domestic afflictions, seems to have
flowed on in peaceful paths, that ran their quiet course between the
hardships of the early years of the colonies and the rising passions and
frequent strifes that reigned, particularly in New England, for years
before the Revolutionary war. His whole nature, tuned to harmony and
peaceful avocations, developed in its proper channel. The comparative
quiet of the first half of the eighteenth century permitted a thorough
devotion to his allotted pursuits. His forty years&#8217; pastorate in Boston
left their trace of love and good-will in seed which can never be
destroyed, and his indefatigable industry and painstaking perseverance
are lessons that could be of benefit to all generations.</p>

<p>He inherited a large property from his father. Beside other lands,
acquired and inherited, he owned the tract which is covered by the town
of Princeton, including Wachusett mountain, the town deriving its name
from him. In the Boylston Mansion at Princeton,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
there is a beautiful
crayon portrait of Mrs. Sarah Gill, his daughter, executed by Copley.
There is also a fine tall clock, which belonged to Mr. Prince, in the
possession of Mrs. Addison Denny, at Leicester. Mr. Prince brought it
with him from England in 1717; the whole case is in raised Japanese
work, and the face decorations very elaborate. It was made by Thomas
Wagstaffe, of London, and his descendants still make clocks at the same
shop, by hand and under the same name.</p>

<p>Mr. Prince died in 1757, after a year&#8217;s illness, at seventy-two years of
age. The <em>Weekly Gazette</em> said, in announcing his death: &ldquo;His
performances in pulpit evidence a vast compass of thought, a sublime
imagination, a great faith and zeal. In printed composures there is a
fertility of invention, correctness of sentiment, sprightliness of
expression, that must delight every reader, and transmit his name to
posterity in the most advantageous light. His private life was amiable
and exemplary, adorned with grace and virtues. A useful member of civil
society. His consort has lost an affectionate husband; his only
surviving daughter, a tender father; his servants, an indulgent master;
his acquaintances, a kind, condescending friend; his church, an
enlightened and vigilant pastor; his country, a zealous advocate of
civil and religious liberty. Took farewell to this world with humble
resignation to the will of God, and entire dependence on our Lord Jesus
Christ, and a good hope of Immortality.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>NEW ENGLAND MANNERS AND CUSTOMS IN THE<br />
TIME OF BRYANT&#8217;S EARLY LIFE.</h2>

<p class="center1">BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.</p>


<p>Ninety-one years ago, in the little town of Cummington, Mass., was born
a child, who was destined, in after years, to be the first of a grand
line of American poets, who have made this, the second century of our
Republic, famous by their genius and originality.</p>

<p>Not long since, in looking over an old magazine, published in
Philadelphia in 1809, I came across quite an extended review of
Campbell&#8217;s, then just issued, poem, &ldquo;Gertrude of Wyoming,&rdquo; and was
not a little amused at the closing comments.</p>

<p>After a little mild praise, and a good deal of equally mild criticism,
of the Scotch poet, the editor goes on to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, after all, although lesser poets are constantly rising above the
literary horizon, challenging the admiration of the reading world for a
few short months,&mdash;possibly years,&mdash;and then sinking into the obscurity
of a forgotten past, the sun of English poetry has set forever. With
Pope, Milton, and Dryden, England lost her last true poets. Henceforth
all who claim that title must be more or less skilful <em>imitators</em> merely
of the great masters who have gone before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for America,&rdquo; he continues, with the most unpatriotic candor, &ldquo;there
is not the smallest chance of her ever producing a real poet. Ingenious
scribblers she may have, without doubt, but the typical American never
had or will have one grain of poetry in his hard, shrewd, matter-of-fact
nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the verdict of a Philadelphia editor seventy-six years ago.
To-day the bust of our own Longfellow stands in Westminster Abbey, side
by side with a Chaucer and a Shakspere, while not only the
English-speaking world on both sides of the ocean, but the dwellers in
sunny Italy, upon the frozen steppes of Russia, and in far-off Japan and
India, sing and repeat, each in his own tongue, the stirring
battle-hymns and sweet home-songs of the gifted singers of our Western
World.</p>

<p>We are often reminded that a writer&#8217;s environments have much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> to do with
the character of his writings, and in Bryant&#8217;s case this fact is
particularly noticeable.</p>

<p>His earliest poems, and especially that great masterpiece,
&ldquo;Thanatopsis,&rdquo; written at the early age of eighteen, show unmistakably
that the boy had grown up in the closest familiarity with the
theological tenets of the New England of his day, and that the bent of
his young mind was, even then, toward graver subjects than would
naturally occupy the thoughts of a boy of that age.</p>

<p>His biographers assert that he drew his inspiration for this grand poem
from the pages of Kirke White and Southey. But whatever his acquaintance
with these poets may have done for him, there is a striking similarity
of imagery and sentiment between his own and the writings of the sacred
bards, whose utterances were as familiar to the children of a Christian
household in those days as their own childish nursery songs and hymns.</p>

<p>For instance, compare these lines from &ldquo;Thanatopsis&rdquo; with a well-known
passage in the Book of Job:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">&ldquo;... Yet the dead are there:</span><br />
And millions in those solitudes, since first<br />
The flight of years began, have laid them down<br />
In their last sleep,&mdash;the dead reign there alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sacred poet says:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">&ldquo;Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw
after him as there are innumerable before him.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Then, again, in &ldquo;The Old Man&#8217;s Funeral&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;Then rose another hoary man, and said,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">In faltering accents, to that weeping train:</span><br />
&lsquo;Why mourn ye that our aged friend is dead?<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Ye are not sad to see the gathered grain.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Compare this with:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">
  &ldquo;Thou shall come to the grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn
cometh in his season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Examples similar to these occur in many of Bryant&#8217;s poems, and tend to
show the result of the early religious training, that, as the son of a
thoughtful, God-fearing New England gentleman of that day, he most
certainly did receive.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
That he was intensely, grandly, sometimes fiercely patriotic, is also
due, in a great measure, to the surrounding influences of his young
life.</p>

<p>The struggle for American independence was at last over, and the lusty
young Republic, springing, Minerva-like, from the mighty brain of a no
longer imperilled freedom, was ready to throw down the gauntlet of
defiance to all the world, and assert her rights as queen regnant of the
great Western World.</p>

<p>The armies had been disbanded, and the war-scarred veterans had joyfully
returned to their farms and workshops, ready to put their willing hands
again to the plough and the plane, and help to restore, by patient toil
and honest legislation, prosperity and peace to the land so long
distracted by the commotions and uncertainties of war.</p>

<p>Later, his days of toil over, the old soldier sat him down, in restful
content, by his own peaceful fireside, while, with the old musket in its
honored place above the tall wooden mantle, he fought over again, in
memory, his old-time battles, and to sons and grandsons taught, in
thrilling, patriotic words, the great lesson to love and revere their
country next to their God.</p>

<p>As a boy, no doubt, young Bryant had listened to many of the tales of
these honored veterans, and had drank in, with the air of his own native
village, long draughts of their fervid patriotism, that animated his
writings down to the latest years of his life.</p>

<p>That he had seen with his own eyes some of the leading spirits in that
great national struggle, who still lived to honor and be honored by the
nation that they had fought so bravely to free from a foreign yoke, is
shown by an extract from one of his few humorous poems, in which he
says:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
                <span style="margin-left: 8em;">&ldquo;I pause to state</span><br />
That I, too, have seen greatness&mdash;even I&mdash;<br />
Shook hands with Adams, stared at Lafayette,<br />
When, barehead, in the hot noon of July,<br />
He would not let the umbrella be held o&#8217;er him,<br />
For which three cheers burst from the mob before him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patriotic, religious, philosophical, and a true lover of nature, yet
Bryant cannot, in any mood, be styled one of our fireside poets, like
Longfellow, Whittier, and Lowell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
Perhaps he failed to see in the then bare loneliness of the typical
New England home a beauty worth the attention of his fastidious and
lofty-minded muse. And that New England homes, at that time, were bare
of what we, to-day, deem the absolute necessities of life, no student of
the past pretends to deny.</p>

<p>The long war had drained and impoverished the country; our manufactures
and commerce were then in their infancy; the whole machinery of our
recently organized government was new, and the hands that worked it,
however wise and brave they might be, were untried, and had much to
learn before the ponderous works could be brought into perfect running
order.</p>

<p>Worst of all, President Jefferson, in 1807, laid an embargo upon
American shipping, thus unwittingly striking a terrible blow at our
foreign commerce, in his endeavor to force England into an amicable
settlement of certain difficulties that had arisen between her and the
young Republic. This, and the two years&#8217; war with England, that broke
out in 1812, made hard times for everybody, and taxed the magnanimity
and skill of our foremothers to their utmost to make their homes and
families present a decent and respectable appearance.</p>

<p>The very poor then, as now, were forced to content themselves with the
barest decencies of life. But the respectable middle classes,&mdash;the
farmers, mechanics, and small merchants,&mdash;were put to the greatest
straits to keep up an appearance of respectability and comfort, with
scant conveniences, and few or none of even the simplest elegancies of
life, in dwelling, dress, or furniture.</p>

<p>The principal room of a New England farm-house was the kitchen, which
was usually large enough to serve for a cooking, dining, and sitting
room, all in one.</p>

<p>The enormous fireplace, with its long, soot-blackened crane, hung with
hooks of various sizes, the massive iron andirons, strong enough to hold
the great birch and birchen logs, that often taxed the strength of a
full-grown man to lift and adjust in their places, occupied a large part
of one side of the room, and served as a kind of family altar, about
which the family, with their guests and friends, always assembled, in
quiet chat or friendly gossip.</p>

<p>And a cheery spot it was, especially in those long, dark evenings in
midwinter, when the ruddy, dancing flames went laughing up the great
throat of the chimney, chasing the venturesome, wayward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
sparks, as they
hurried out into the untried darkness of the winter&#8217;s night. With what a
genial glow they lighted up the bare, unplastered walls, the sanded
floor, the rough rafters overhead, and the scant, clumsily-fashioned
furniture, until</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;The rude, bare-raftered room<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Nor must we forget that seldom wanting, always interesting, piece of
furniture, to which was sure to be accorded the warmest, coziest spot in
the wide chimney-corner,&mdash;the inevitable wooden cradle,&mdash;clumsily
fashioned by loving, but unskilled hands, and always large enough to
hold, besides the reigning baby, two, and, at a pinch, three, of the
younger members of the household.</p>

<p>How the favored youngsters delighted in a ride in that clumsy old
vehicle, nor dreamed that its halting, uncertain gait was other than the
very poetry of motion! Even mother&#8217;s own wooden rocking-chair, a bit of
boughten elegance, with its gay patchwork cushion, and dull, contented
&ldquo;creak! creak!&rdquo; as its dear occupant swayed meditatively to and fro,
knitting in hand, in the quiet, restful gloaming, was not quite equal to
that dear, delightful old cradle, for a good brisk canter to &ldquo;Banbury
Cross,&rdquo; or to the famous hunting grounds, where &ldquo;Baby Bunting&#8217;s rabbit
skin&rdquo; was waiting for him.</p>

<p>Many a man, and woman too, whose names are, to-day, blessed and honored
by thousands of grateful hearts all over the land, dreamed then their
first misty, childish dreams of a grand and helpful manhood and
womanhood, and felt swelling up within their young souls inexpressible
longings to help right the wrongs of the down-trodden and oppressed,
which they heard their elders talk of, and deplore as past remedy.</p>

<p>The light of other days was simply a home-made tallow candle, and as
matches were not then invented, careful housewives never suffered the
kitchen-fire, even in the hottest days of summer, to die out entirely.
The frequent sight of a child running to the nearest neighbor&#8217;s, with a
long-handled iron fire-shovel in hand, to &ldquo;borry a few coals ter start
the fire up,&rdquo; was looked upon as a sure sign of slack housewifery; and
no woman might lay claim to the distinction of a good housekeeper who
failed to renew her cedar broom as often as every other week.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
Equal simplicity in dress prevailed, and a gown of bombazette&mdash;a very
narrow, all-wool goods, worth from seventy-five cents to a dollar a
yard,&mdash;was often worn for best during the owner&#8217;s lifetime, and at her
death bequeathed, with the fondly-cherished string of gold beads, to the
favorite granddaughter, as a precious legacy.</p>

<p>For common wear, pressed home-made and home-dyed flannel in winter; and
cotton and linen, woven in colored stripes or plaids, for summer, was
considered plenty good enough, even for the doctor&#8217;s and minister&#8217;s
wives. Under flannels were an unheard-of luxury. And one ceases to
wonder at the frequency of hereditary consumption, in our own day, when
he reads that fashionable city ladies, in the very depths of a Northern
winter, walked the icy streets in thin cotton or silk stockings and low,
pointed, high-heeled morocco shoes. Rubbers being then unknown, and the
shoes of stout calf-skin, that their country cousins were only too glad
to get, were disdained by these dainty dames as coarse and unlady-like.</p>

<p>A girl carded, spun, wove, bleached, and made her one white linen gown,
lavishing upon it all her simple art of needlecraft, every seam and hem
stitched by the old-time rule, &ldquo;take up one thread and skip two,&rdquo; and,
perhaps, embroidering a pattern of tiny sprays and eyelets upon the
bosom and sleeves, to give it an air of special gentility.</p>

<p>Finished at last, this choice bit of girlish finery probably served its
owner for a wedding-dress, and afterwards was cut up into slips for the
babies.</p>

<p>Matrons, young as well as old, wore caps of plain white muslin, made
after the same fashion as the round, sweeping caps that tidy
housekeepers wear at the present day. The younger and gayer ones, who
had no scruples of conscience on the subject, wore their caps adorned
with bright ribbons, while the elderly and more sedate contented
themselves with a plain band of black, across the front, and pinned
primly at the back, without bow or knot.</p>

<p>After the death of Washington, in 1799, besides the band of crape that
every citizen of the United States, by the desire of Congress, wore upon
his left arm for thirty days, many of the loyal matrons provided
themselves with mourning-cap ribbons,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
upon which was stamped, in white letters, upon a black ground:</p>

<p class="center">
        &ldquo;General George Washington,<br />
Departed this life on the 14th of December,<br />
               1799, &AElig;. 68,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;a fac-simile of the inscription upon the coffin-plate of that
illustrious and well-beloved chief. The wool and flax were home
productions, but the cotton was brought, in a raw state, from the West
Indies.</p>

<p>It was first picked over very carefully, to remove the seeds and stray
bits of foreign rubbish, then &ldquo;batted,&rdquo; that is, made into small pats,
each large enough to be carded into a roll, which was spun into thread
upon either a wool or linnen wheel. This &ldquo;batting&rdquo; usually fell to the
lot of the children of the family, who probably found the monotonous
task as little to their taste as their grandchildren do, when required
to wash the dishes or saw wood for the cooking-stove.</p>

<p>Woven plain, by the skilful hands of the housemother, and bleached upon
the young grass under the blossoming apple boughs, the cloth served for
the underwear of the family, and was regarded as one of the few luxuries
of the frugal household,&mdash;the raw cotton costing over fifty cents a
pound, to say nothing of the time and labor required to convert it into
cloth.</p>

<p>On account of the scarcity of cotton, our modern &ldquo;comfortables&rdquo; were a
thing unheard of, and, for a substitute, woollen quilts, stuffed with
wool, and closely quilted, often in the most elaborate patterns, were
used in all New England households. These quilts were often few and thin
in many a poor home, where the elders had hard work to shield their
flock of little ones from the bitter cold of winter, in spite of the
immense fires that even the poorest were able to provide where any
amount of fuel could be had for the cutting.</p>

<p>I have heard a story of a good lady who lived at that time in a town not
a hundred miles from Boston, which gives one some idea of the straits to
which our grandparents were often reduced in those days:&mdash;</p>

<p>Watching one bitterly cold night with a sick neighbor, she heard, at
midnight, the little children crying with cold in the loft overhead, and
leaving her sleeping patient, she went upstairs, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
tried to find an
extra quilt or blanket to spread over them. But in vain, for in that
poor home there was not so much as a shoulder-blanket that could be
spared. At last, in utter desperation, she spread over the shivering
little ones a <em>side of leather</em>, that she found rolled up under the
eaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It kept out the cold, anyhow,&rdquo; she said, as she told the story years
afterwards. &ldquo;And the poor little things stopped their cryin&#8217;, and
cuddled down as contented an&#8217; comfortable as a nestful o&#8217; kittens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If there was little of poetry or romance in the lives of those
hard-working, hard farming men and women of a past generation, there was
no lack of the patient diligence and simple, unquestioning faith, that
give strength to weakness, and sweeten toil with the steadfast belief
that, to the faithful heart and willing hand God&#8217;s blessing never fails.</p>

<p>One of the favorite proverbs at that time is significant, as proverbs
usually are, of the character of the people:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin your web, and God will supply you with thread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While still another suggests that well-known element in the New England
character that the Scotch aptly call &ldquo;canny&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wise man will bend a little rather than be torn up by the roots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Extravagance was more than a fault, it was an actual sin, in the eyes of
these prudent, simple-living folk, and you may have heard before the
story of the ingenious housewife, who, tired of the blank bareness of
her yellow-painted floors, conceived the bold idea of manufacturing a
carpet for it herself:</p>

<p>A large square of sail-cloth served her for a canvas, and upon this she
painted, with the few colors that she could procure, a pattern of
flowers of every kind that she was familiar with,&mdash;blue roses and green
lilies having the preference, as making more show than their humbler
sisters. This, when finished, she covered with a thick coat of varnish,
thus making a very good substitute for the more modern oil-cloth.</p>

<p>Of course everybody, from far and near, came to look, and wonder, and
admire; and among them a good old deacon, who, after critically
surveying the wonderful work, turned to the proud artist, and, with a
look half of amazement, half of pitying reproach, upon his honest,
weather-beaten face, asked solemnly:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sister&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, do you expect to have <em>all this</em>
and <em>heaven</em> too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To-day, Boston is sometimes jestingly styled the &ldquo;Hub of the Universe,&rdquo;
but at the beginning of the present century it was, soberly speaking,
the Hub of New England, for from it spokes projected into every part,
however distant, of that region.</p>

<p>As in past ages all roads led to Rome, so seventy-five or eighty years
ago all roads led to or from Boston. In an old Farmer&#8217;s Almanac, printed
in 1817, I find, among other things quaint and curious, four
closely-printed pages devoted to &ldquo;Roads to the Principal Towns of the
Continent from Boston, with the distances and names of Innkeepers.&rdquo;
Beginning with: &ldquo;From Boston to Newport, over Seekonk, through Rehoboth,
69 miles,&rdquo; and ending with &ldquo;Down the Ohio, to the mouth of the
Muskinqum, 524 miles,&rdquo;&mdash;a tolerably long ride in those days of the
old-fashioned stage coach.</p>

<p>Naturally, this Umbilicus of the Western World set the fashions in
theology, literature, dress, and manners for all New England, and any
one who had made a trip to Boston was venerated as a kind of travelled
wonder, and forever after regarded as an authority upon all mooted
points of general interest.</p>

<p>It has been said, on what authority I am unable to state, that &ldquo;all good
Americans go to Paris when they die.&rdquo; But in those days of Boston&#8217;s
supremacy an aspiring dame in one of our Maine villages, finding herself
upon her death bed, expressed as her one last wish, that she &ldquo;might be
permitted to go to heaven by the way o&#8217; Boston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently the poor soul had pined in vain all her life for a sight of
its splendors, and could think of nothing so near akin to heaven as a
peep at this earthly Paradise on her way there.</p>

<p>I might go on indefinitely to call up pictures, heroic, quaint, or
pathetic, of these earnest-hearted men and women, who toiled, suffered,
and planned, for the future, that we, their children, have entered into
the fulness of. But time forbids, and I can only say, in closing this
paper, that it will be well for us, if, in these days of national
prosperity and power, when Liberty, proudly triumphant, stands like</p>

ready to hold his own alike against traitors at home and envious
despotisms abroad, we do not forget with what a world of self-sacrifice
and patient toil our forbears laid the foundations of this great, free
government; nor should we deem it a light thing to have been born
citizens of a Republic a thousand times grander, nobler, and, God grant!
far more enduring, than those of heathen Greece and Rome, that have long
since fallen to decay, and now lie buried beneath the melancholy dust of
centuries.</p>

<h2>NEW ENGLAND CHARACTERISTICS.</h2>

<p class="center1">BY LIZZIE M. WHITTLESEY.</p>


<p>&ldquo;We constantly,&rdquo; as Ruskin affirms, &ldquo;recognize things by their least
important attributes, and by help of very few of these. We recognize our
books by their bindings, our friends by the mere accidents of the body,
the sport of climate, and food, and time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Applying this principle to New England, we unconsciously recognize her
first by her mere outward, incidental properties.</p>

<p>By the waving of her hair in the &ldquo;Pine-Tree State,&rdquo; by the frown of her
massive brows in the &ldquo;Granite&rdquo; and &ldquo;Green Mountain,&rdquo; by the glancing
brightness of her smile in the &ldquo;Old Bay,&rdquo; by her lithe grace of limb in
&ldquo;Little Rhoda,&rdquo; and her firm step and erect carriage in the &ldquo;Land of
Steady Habits;&rdquo; while to all alike belong&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;Her clear, warm heaven at noon, the mist that shrouds<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Her twilight hills, her cool and starry eves,</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">The glorious splendor of her sunset clouds,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The rainbow beauty of her forest leaves.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Next to the physical traits of a friend we are attracted by those of a
social nature; and, still keeping the analogy, the same is true of a
people, and pre&euml;minently so of New England.</p>

<p>The characteristics of our four Northern cities have been thus
distinctively classified and labelled:&mdash;</p>

<p>Washington stops between the polka and the waltz to ask, &ldquo;Can you
dance?&rdquo; New York shows us her silks and laces, and politely whispers,
&ldquo;What are you worth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philadelphia traces back our genealogy, and questions, &ldquo;Who was your
grandfather?&rdquo; While Boston lifts her eye-glass, and, surveying our
mental cranium, inquires, &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The social traits of New England proper are so combined with her
business character that they are with difficulty separated, and both are
best defined by foreign visitors.</p>

<p>It was an Englishman who said, &ldquo;Go ahead is the grand doctrine of New
England;&rdquo; and we see that this principle, plainly enforced and
practically carried out, builds her cities, founds her public libraries,
carries on her immense commerce, and increases public traffic.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Without this quality, coupled with her independence and disregard for
romantic associations, the Yankee would never make pilgrimages to the
Old World for the sole and evident purpose of placarding the pyramids,
and introducing his invention for removing stains at some half-ruined
cathedral whose famous &ldquo;spot of blood&rdquo; is cherished with reverent care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;New England excels,&rdquo; according to an English cousin, &ldquo;in an openness to
ideas, an aptness for intuitions, and sometimes a seemingly positive
preference for the bird in the bush,&rdquo; which latter may account for that
skilful Yankee versatility so perfectly exemplified in the chaplain,
poet, editor, merchant, speculator, politician, historian, and minister,
Barlow.</p>

<p>It is this quiet independence, indomitable will, and never-ceasing
purpose to &ldquo;get on,&rdquo; which is a characteristic of the New England women,
and which may be summed up in the expressive adjective &ldquo;capable.&rdquo; Armed
with this power, she cheerfully teaches school, makes dresses, binds
books, or &ldquo;keeps house,&rdquo; considering no honest work degrading, and
proving herself equally efficient in each.</p>

<p>Here is found that shrewd, stirring common-sense which is New England&#8217;s
strong point. Here is hinted, also, that philosophic humor which is the
one ray lightening her intense realism.</p>

<p>As indefinable as it is delightful, it comes with a lightning flash of
wit into the dry, theological conversation of the preacher, relieves
with its sharp hits the spread-eagle speech of the country orator,
brightens with its apt allusions the more refined periods of the
lecturer, flits charmingly in and out of the sympathetic essays of
Holmes, keeps us in a perpetual chuckle over the mirthful pages of
Irving, and embodies itself in the quaint good-nature of an indolent,
contemplative Sam Lawson.</p>

<p>For nowhere is this genial quality found in such purity as among the
true, rustic Yankees, whose clear-cut, homely phrases and sharp
localisms are not as entirely extinct as is supposed. Country life has a
way all its own of preserving the best traits of a people, and in more
than one old-fashioned farm-house, and among the haymakers in more than
one sunny meadow, may be heard the witty expressions and strong
metaphors which led Dickens to say, &ldquo;In shrewdness of remark and a
certain cast-iron quaintness the Yankee people unquestionably take the
lead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the country, too, as if growing and blossoming under the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
influence of the warm, unobstructed sunshine, is the sturdy growth of genuineness,
hearty, co&ouml;perative sympathy, and cheery hospitality, the latter having
its highest exponent in New England&#8217;s distinctive festival,
Thanksgiving. The dear old holiday may well be called the cradle of New
England graces, for it bears much the same relation to the development
of her social traits that the old Greek and Roman games bore in
developing characteristics of strength and bravery.</p>

<p>To return to the criticism of foreigners. The absence of historic
records and relics in New England has often been a matter of contempt,
and an amusing story is told by J. T. Fields of a stiff, conventional
Englishman who called on the poet Longfellow at one of his busiest
hours, and scanning him closely, gravely remarked: &ldquo;We were doing the
sights, sir, and as there are no ruins in New England, we decided to
come and see you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We smile at the strange idea, but is there not in it a tacit admission
that New England&#8217;s men and women of letters are her best
characteristics? Is it not to her glory that hers is <em>not</em> a country of
ruins but one of noble, earnest, <em>living</em> men and women?&mdash;men like Dr.
Hale, instilling by the quiet weapon of the pen strong, true lessons of
benevolence and truth; men like Longfellow, singing, pure, earnest songs
of high endeavor and noble attainment; men like Whittier, whose simple,
touching strains move so grandly on the side of right and justice.</p>

<p>Women like Mrs. Stowe, who, in her great strength of mind and character,
wrote that wonderful book, which, inspired by zeal, and fired by a
terrible earnestness, filled New England once with something of her own
noble enthusiasm. She could do the grand work then, because her country
needed it, thus illustrating that strong New England trait, latent
power, a power of which we know nothing till it is called out by some
mighty need. There have been earnest purpose, determined will, pure
motive, and unselfish heroism in New England; but their depth and
strength have never been &ldquo;guessed&rdquo; till manifested in some great crisis.</p>

<p>Her contests are those of heart and intellect; and her weapons, hard
study and earnest thought.</p>

<p>In spite of popular philippics her traits do not change much from the
summary of them made fifty years ago, &ldquo;Impatience with wrong, quarrel
with precedent, love of education, and faith in God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
Ah! now we touch the true characteristics of New England, lying in the
deep ocean of her history, unmoved by the lighter traits sparkling upon
the surface.</p>

<p>That is a true boast of Jonathan to John:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;We aint so weak and poor, John,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With twenty million people,</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">And close to every door, John,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A school-house and a steeple.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>And this is but the outgrowth of that short formula of the brave
founders of school and church: &ldquo;Faith in God, faith in man, faith in
work;&rdquo; so that New England&#8217;s present traits are directly traceable to
Puritan influence.</p>

<p>Our educational institutions had substantial foundation-stones of
self-sacrifice and far-seeing purpose, nobly laid by that score of
sturdy men, dedicating, for the first academy, a peck of corn, or a
shilling in cash, or a few treasured volumes.</p>

<p>The Sabbath has been called the &ldquo;poem of New England,&rdquo; and it is that
always, whether rung out by the city&#8217;s chiming bells or whispered in the
sacred repose of the country church. But it was never so truly a poem as
on that first New England Sabbath, when the church was a weather-beaten
ship, its support the lashing waves, and the worshippers &ldquo;a handful of
sad, stern men and women kneeling in their spray-stiffened garments to
thank God for freedom to worship him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>New England&#8217;s best traits, then, are but her rightful inheritance;
traits &ldquo;lineally descended&rdquo; from her founders, softened and purified in
the transmitting many times, as in the case of their sectional loyalty.
&ldquo;They seemed to shrink from trying to get to heaven by any other road
than that which their fathers travelled, lest they should miss them at
their journey&#8217;s end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in these days, thank God! religious toleration is creeping over the
forbidding rock of New England theology, much as the delicate vines of
the May-flower crept over and beautified the hard, unyielding soil.</p>

<p>Thus New England stands, in her freedom, love of education, and all
those homely domestic traits which make her the comfortable, clever,
strong, and tender mother she is, while under and through and over all
her traits runs, like a strain of restful music, her great, all
powerful, far-reaching faith.</p>

<h2>EDITOR&#8217;S TABLE.</h2>


<p>A great stride of advancement has been taken in the cultivation of that
rarest of supernal graces, Christian charity, since the ancient
patriarchs of New England fell asleep. Occasionally opportunity is given
us of measuring &ldquo;with the eye&rdquo; the distance which has been travelled.
More than a hundred and fifty years ago Dr. Cotton Mather spoke of Rhode
Island as &ldquo;the Gerizzim of New England, the common receptacle of the
convicts of Jerusalem and the outcasts of the land.&rdquo; The island itself,
as a portion of God&#8217;s creation, he was willing to think worthy of all
praise. He seems to have felt regarding it as Bishop Heber felt about
India when he wrote his immortal missionary hymn:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;And every prospect pleases,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And only man is vile.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The island is, indeed, for the fertility of its soil, the temperateness
of its air, etc., the best garden of all the colony, and were it free
from serpents I would call it the Paradise of New England.&rdquo; As things
were, however, the good old man could only say regretfully, &ldquo;<em>Bona
terra, mala gens</em>.&rdquo; He evidently fancied that the serpent was not a
native of the original home of human innocence, or else his special
affection for the people of Rhode Island led him to wish for them an
exemption from exposures which God had not thought necessary to the
safety and happiness of Adam. The serpent was an honorable member of the
animal community in Paradise before Ithuriel&#8217;s &ldquo;spear of heaven-tempered
steel&rdquo; discovered Satan, in the shape of a toad, breathing into the ear
of the sleeping &ldquo;Mother of Mankind&rdquo; deadly insinuations of disobedience
and rebellion, just as freedom in religion&mdash;the serpent so unworthily
abhorred by New England Puritanism&mdash;was a divinely chartered and
precious privilege of mankind long before the founding of Rhode Island
colonies or the birth of Roger Williams. The vagaries and fantasies of
freedom, its excesses, outrages, and crimes, are something fearful to
contemplate, but freedom is, has been, and must ever continue to be, the
essential condition of human power and excellence. It has ever been the
madness of men&mdash;and madness that could not claim the poor excuse of
method&mdash;to think of cutting down the tree of liberty, and still hope to
retain the benefits and blessings of its shade.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
The statistics of marriages, as compared with those of population, would
seem to indicate that there is an increasing unwillingness on the part
of men or women, or both, to take upon themselves the responsibilities
of wedded life. Whether because of the increased expense of living due
to the development of luxurious tastes, and the selfishness which
results; or the difficulties in the way of securing remunerative and
constant employment; or because of other reasons, the sly god seems to
have lost something of his former power. Perhaps the chief cause lies
with the young men, who dare neither to face the cares of matrimony
themselves, nor to ask others to do so. Whatever there is of cowardice
in this matter, we do not believe that it can, as a rule, be charged
upon the women of America, without regard to their station in life. It
is claimed that in Massachusetts, of every 1,000 inhabitants in
1850-1860, 21 married, now only 17; that in Connecticut, while the
population has increased 56 per cent during the last decade, marriages
have increased but 34 per cent; that in Providence, R.I., while the
number capable of marrying was in the last decade 115 percent greater
than in the decade preceding the war, the number who married was only 77
per cent greater; and that in Ohio, while, in 1850-1880, the inhabitants
had increased 37 per cent, the number of marriages had advanced only 26
per cent.</p>

<p>Mistakes go in pairs. It was a mistake for a body of Protestant
ministers to meddle in the matter of the succession to a generalship in
the army, and it is a mistake for the <em>Catholic Standard</em> to make this
the occasion for invidious statements in reference to the service of
Catholics in the late war. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;was any company or any
regiment or brigade that entwined on its colors emblems of the Catholic
faith, and on the eve of a battle knelt to receive absolution from a
Catholic priest, recorded but as first to advance and last to retreat.
And since then, whether in barracks or in camp, ... you look in vain for
any disgraceful record of Catholic privates and officers.&rdquo; We submit
that neither caste nor class nor sect has any place in determining the
relative merits of the brave soldiers who fought in the Civil War. In
camp, and upon the field of battle, they stood side by side, not as New
Yorkers, Vermonters, Germans, Irishmen, Catholics, or Protestants, but
as patriotic Americans. Some of these, perhaps, were better soldiers
because they were devout Catholics, and others because they were earnest
Presbyterians or Methodists, and this for the reason that those who fear
God are the readier to face duty, brave danger, and die for country. No:
our army is not an army of Catholics, Baptists, etc., but an army of
Americans.</p>

Is it true that &ldquo;a very large part of our free education system is
devoted to teaching the principles of Nihilism, the absurdities of
evolution, the crudities of the nineteenth-century philosophy, weakest
and most watery of all the philosophies of the ages&rdquo;? Dr. William C.
Prime makes this claim in the New-York <em>Journal of Commerce</em>, and then
says, &ldquo;Of what use it is to read the Bible in the morning, and teach in
the afternoon that the Bible is a poor fiction, perhaps some one can
explain. That this is precisely what many common schools and free
educational institutions are doing, may be discovered with little
difficulty.&rdquo; With due deference to the opinion of our genial <em>confr&egrave;re</em>,
we cannot accept his conclusions. We have yet to learn of any public
school in which flouting at the Bible or religion enters into the matter
of instruction, and we apprehend that the number of teachers who thus
misuse their office really constitutes so small a fraction of the
teaching community as to be hardly worthy the learned doctor&#8217;s
attention. As a matter of fact, by far the greater number of American
teachers in public schools and private schools, whatever their faults
otherwise, are men and women who are either Christians, or filled with a
reverent regard for the Bible and its teachings.</p>

<p>When Daniel Webster was a youth of eighteen, in college, he wrote to a
friend these suggestive words: &ldquo;I am fully persuaded that our happiness
is much at our regulation, and that the &lsquo;Know thyself&rsquo; of the Greek
philosopher meant no more than rightly to attune and soften our
appetites and passions till they should symphonize like the harp of
David.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Perhaps no one ever paid a finer tribute to conscience than John Adams,
when, after advising his son John Quincy to preserve above all things
his innocence, he said, &ldquo;Your conscience is the minister plenipotentiary
of God Almighty in your heart. See to it that this minister never
negotiates in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>EDUCATION.</h2>


<p>When in any of the chief activities of human life it becomes necessary
to adopt new methods, or to make some new application of old and
well-tried principles, it is always best that change should be
discriminating, gradual, and slow; and perhaps nowhere does this maxim
demand recognition and respect more imperatively than in educational
reform. We are not disposed to find fault with those who contend for the
authority and sway of the progressive spirit of the present as against
the spirit of the past. In science, art, literature, education; in
religion, morals, philosophy, theology, every genuine gain in depth,
breadth, and fulness is to be hailed with a thousand welcomes. It would
be a pity if an unenlightened veneration for the traditions and
principles of a superannuated conservatism were allowed to rob the world
even of the smallest portion of the benefit of a single new and useful
idea.</p>

<p>The needs and duties of each age require that intelligence should
steadily advance, and in the field of truth there is always something
valuable left for the latest gleaner. No one is fitted for the duties of
to-day who dreads the spirit of free inquiry that breathes around him,
and fearlessly addresses its questions in every direction. Especially
should new and better hints be welcomed as to the true science and
method of instructing the youthful mind. Patience, delicacy,
intelligence, and skill are nowhere required more than in this.</p>

<p>But while it is true that each generation must have liberty to do its
work in its own way, no generation can afford to despise or disparage
the wisdom and experience of previous ages, or to institute reforms
which revolutionize the methods and the principles of the past. The
intellectual triumphs and achievements which are the goal of one age are
indeed no more than the starting-point of the next; but the links of
connection must be preserved unbroken. The conditions of a successful
and symmetrical development of the mental powers are substantially the
same in every land and time, and there are great principles which,
however variously we may apply them, can never in themselves be violated
or discarded with impunity. So far as the new education so strenuously
advocated in our day honors and observes the eternal laws of the mind,
we can afford to contemplate the new ventures with equanimity, if not
with hope; but there is reason to fear that the almost unlimited freedom
of individual choice as to subjects of study accorded to young and
inexperienced minds in colleges where new departures have been taken is
scarcely compatible with the compliance those laws rigidly require.</p>

<p>Feb. 10.&mdash;About one hundred sons of the Granite State, the majority of
whom belong to the New Hampshire Club, assembled at the Quincy House,

<p>March 9.&mdash;Meeting of the Bostonian Society. The essayist was J. M.
Hubbard, whose subject was &ldquo;Boston, in 1710, Preparing for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> Small
War.&rdquo; It appeared during the reading that the military enterprise on
hand was the capture of Port Royal, in Nova Scotia, then in the hands of
the French. The reason why Boston was peculiarly interested in it was
that this Nova Scotia harbor was a resort and head-quarters for a great
number of French privateers, which made short cruises along this coast,
capturing many merchant-vessels and fishing-craft, greatly to the injury
of the commerce of Boston. The English Government accordingly sent
hither a small fleet with a body of marines, expecting that the force
would be augmented by troops raised in the Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
and New Hampshire provinces. The whole expedition was to be commanded by
Colonel Francis Nicholson, who came in the fleet from England. To
provide for the requirements of the local forces the Provincial Council
of Massachusetts ordered that &pound;15,000 in bills of credit of the province
be printed, which was a ready way to raise the money.</p>

1868, 1869, 1875, 1883, resulting in the conventions of 1850-1 and
1876-7. The proposition had a sufficient majority this time.</p>

<p>March 12.&mdash;At a special meeting of both branches of the Cambridge City
Council, a special committee was appointed on the part of the city
government to confer with the committee on the part of the citizens
relative to a suitable observance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
departure for the seat of war of Co. C, Third Regiment of Infantry, of
Cambridge. This was the first volunteer company organized for the war of
the rebellion in the city. Ex-Mayors Montague, Saunders, and Harding,
ex-Aldermen Thurston and Chapman, and Mr. J. W. Merrill, made short
addresses, urging the necessity of making the 17th of April a day of
local pride for Cambridge. The following committee on the part of the
citizens was chosen: ex-Mayors Bradford, Harding, Montague, and
Saunders, ex-Alderman F. L. Chapman and D. H. Thurston, and Messrs.
George H. Howard, J. C. Wellington, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
L. B. Porter. On the part of
the City Council there were chosen Mayor Russell, Aldermen Hincks and

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>March 15.&mdash;The regular monthly meeting of the Methodist Historical
Society was one of unusual interest. Rev. Hebron Vincent, of Edgartown,
occupied the chair, and Rev. C. L. Goodell, of Providence, presented and
read an interesting sketch of the rise and progress of Methodism in
Rhode Island, bringing out particularly the history of the Chestnut
Street Church, of which he is the present pastor, and whose
semi-centennial was recently observed. Rev. Dr. Chadbourne, of
Charlestown, found in the files of the <em>Columbian Sentinel</em> for 1806 the
following: &ldquo;On Thursday morning Mrs. Maria Odiorne, aged 29, wife of Mr.
George Odiorne, eldest daughter of the Rev. Jas. Creighton of London,
Eng. Her funeral will proceed from the dwelling of Mr. O., in May
Street, this afternoon at half-past three o&#8217;clock, which the friends and
acquaintances are requested to attend.&rdquo; The interest of the Methodist
fraternity in this lady arises from the fact of her being the daughter
of one of Mr. Wesley&#8217;s most intimate friends and associates, and whose
home was the scene of this great man&#8217;s oft-repeated visits when she was
but fourteen years of age. Her husband, Mr. George Odiorne, met her in
London on one of his business trips across the ocean, and they were
married there, she accompanying him to his American home. Her son, James
Creighton Odiorne, born at his grandfather&#8217;s house in London, graduated
at Yale College in 1826, and was one of the founders of the New England
Anti-Slavery Society, among whose members was the late William Lloyd
Garrison, and of which Oliver Johnson, Esq., is the only living member.
The next meeting of the Society occurs on Monday, April 12. Rev. L. B.
Bates will present a sketch of the late Rev. Lewis Bates.</p>
